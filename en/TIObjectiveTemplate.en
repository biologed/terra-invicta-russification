TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessHydraCorpus=Recovered alien corpse
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessHydraCorpus=We have retrieved the intact body of an extraterrestrial.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessHydraCorpus=Few among us would ever have believed this day would come. Not only inarguable proof of life from another world, but the successful retrieval of an intact alien body, ours to study at our leisure. Returning it to our labs has been a challenge, however. Its cellular structure began to deteriorate at an alarming rate, which we believe to be due to some sort of genetically-programmed fail-safe — presumably to prevent this race's enemies from learning more about them.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we were well-equipped enough to quickly transfer the corpse into cryogenic storage, by which point only its outermost extremities had succumbed to necrosis. More problematically, the pathologists tasked with initial assessment of the body quickly fell into an inexplicable stupor. The effect dissipated within a few hours, and did not repeat. A full post-mortem may now begin.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessLiveHydra=Captured live alien
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessLiveHydra=We have come face to face with a sapient being from another world.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessLiveHydra=It is impossible to describe the sensation of gazing upon a creature from another world with one's own eyes. No words could adequately explain how uncanny it feels to see such a thing move, and draw breath — and turn its own, unquestionably alien eyes upon us.<br/><br/>Even had we sent a poet, they would not be able to convey the mingled sense of awe and <i>wrongness</i>, the terrifying privilege of beholding something that does not resemble anything else in human experience. The shape of the hulking skull, the tendrils that danced unnaturally within the mouth, the way the light plays across flesh textured and patterned like nothing else on Earth ...<br/><br/>Even these beings' sounds challenge our very definition of language. The idea that we could ever know their minds seems, for now, frankly laughable. Let us hope that will soon change.<br/><br/>Regardless of the fleeting encounters we or others might have had previously, and no matter what happens next, this is a watershed moment, never to be forgotten.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessAlienTech=Salvaged alien technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessAlienTech=We have recovered advanced extraterrestrial artifacts for study.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessAlienTech=We have retrieved a veritable treasure trove of extraterrestrial technology — a raft of inscrutable machines whose even basic function currently eludes us, metals whose very structure is wildly unfamiliar, and even screws and bolts with almost preposterous tensile strength. To call this a motherlode would be the understatement of the millennium.<br/><br/>We have so much to learn from every last fragment of this haul — for it surely represents the technological apex of a species that has somehow found a way to travel from their far-distant world to ours. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessAlienShip=Salvaged alien spacecraft
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessAlienShip=We have gained access to a recovered extraterrestrial vessel.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessAlienShip=Although we have been able to some extent study alien technology before now, to have access to one of their craft in its entirety is a godsend to science. This is how they access our skies. This is how they travel within the Solar System. This is what we must learn from, and perhaps even emulate, if we are to truly do the same ourselves.<br/><br/>Even a preliminary appraisal of the retrieved vessel has revealed a sizable quantity of materials that defy easy categorization — something that is not only countless steps beyond our own technology, but profoundly different from it. Something, perhaps, that would not exist in our solar system had these beings not brought it here. If we can understand it, the potential is beyond words.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessGriffinCorpus=Recovered avian alien corpse
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessGriffinCorpus=We have retrieved the body of a "Griffin" creature for study.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessGriffinCorpus=We have successfully retrieved the body of one of the creatures we have nicknamed "Griffins." A preliminary assessment confirms that it is an entirely different species to the aliens first encountered on Earth — as different from them as we humans are from, say, a dragonfly. Indeed, so thin and hollow are this alien's bones that it seems unlikely it even originated from the same planet as the other aliens. Most probably, it hails from a far lower-gravity environment, which would also explain how rarely this particular species has been sighted on Earth.<br/><br/>While the bone structure arguably invites comparison to avian life on our own world — hence the designation "Griffin" — the similarities end there. This creature is, in every sense of the word, alien.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessLiveGriffin=Captured live avian alien
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessLiveGriffin=We have secured a living Griffin.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessLiveGriffin=Having recovered and performed initial assessment of a living "Griffin" creature, we have no doubt that this is a sapient species. An obvious intelligence glints in its otherworldly eyes — but also what looks for all the world like fear. Despite its grotesque appearance, it seems strangely cowed, even deferential in the presence of humans — flinching when we draw near, and showing no objection to any request we might make of it — those few that it understands, at least.<br/><br/>This behavior would seem to suggest that the creature is accustomed to following orders; whatever place the Griffin occupy in the alien hierarchy, it is surely not one of leadership.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessSalamanderCorpus=Recovered theropod alien corpse
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessSalamanderCorpus=We have retrieved the corpse of a "Salamander"-type alien.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessSalamanderCorpus=Initial examination of the body of this "Salamander," as this superficially reptilian creature has been dubbed, suggests a species either bred for war or born in the crucible of it. Its body is pure muscle and sinew, to such an extent that its tail alone could snap a human neck with ease, and protected by a hide tougher than many metals. Yet, for all its bestial aspect, it is — or was — intelligent enough to wield a firearm. This creature is visually frightening to our people; even as a corpse, it is deeply unsettling to behold.<br/><br/>It would be hard to envisage a more effective shock trooper than the Salamander — though the many livid scars which criss-cross this corpse's armored flesh may suggest that its kind do not perform this role entirely willingly.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessLiveSalamander=Captured live theropod alien
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessLiveSalamander=We recover a live specimen of the aliens known as Salamanders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessLiveSalamander=Beauty is not skin-deep, it is said — and neither, it would seem, is monstrosity. The captive Salamander demonstrates neither obvious fear nor compliance, instead bristling with barely-withheld aggression at all times. Yet this is clearly no animal; it watches carefully, choosing its moments and its actions carefully, never recklessly.<br/><br/>The Salamander is a chilling being to find oneself in the presence of — the coiled might of the thing, the eyes that emanate only cold hatred, and most of all the sense that it is patiently waiting for the perfect moment to strike. If it is, as we suspect, a mere footsoldier in a war we do not yet wholly comprehend, it is nevertheless one more than capable of its own decision-making. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessWarDogCorpus=Recovered alien war dog
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessWarDogCorpus=We have recovered the carcass of one of the bestial creatures deployed by the aliens.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessWarDogCorpus=The body of the creature we have, in the absence of words to better reflect this beast's frightful appearance, named a "War Dog," has been sent for further study. A pre-autopsy assessment has confirmed it to be non-sapient. The brain is small, encased within an unusually thick skull and, as with the canines for which it is named, its appendages would simply not be capable of operating tools or weapons.<br/><br/>The War Dog corpse does display some visible commonalities with what we have observed of the primary aliens, suggesting that they may originate from the same world, but this particular creature bears all the hallmarks of a subservient race. It is quite clearly a natural-born killer, and perhaps even an apex predator, but trained to obey — and to attack.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.DetectXenoforming=Alien life forms detected
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.DetectXenoforming=We have discovered signs of non-sapient alien life on Earth.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.DetectXenoforming=Scattered and garbled reports of unusual plantlife have now given way to confirmed sightings of vegetation never before seen on Earth. Strange growths have erupted from the affected land, connected by a pulsing lattice of tendril-like roots. Although this unknown flora appears superficially plant-like, its connected nature is more analogous to fungal growth. Furthermore, small movements have been detected among and around these growths, suggesting that whatever has been done to the local environment has enabled other, as yet undocumented, forms of alien life to survive here on Earth.<br/><br/>While these changes remain localized for now, the ultimate purpose of this "xenoforming" is as yet unclear. Do our visitors similarly require it for their own survival, it is to gain some strategic foothold, are they growing something else within the affected environments — or do they seek to transform our entire world into a simulacrum of theirs?

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AccessAlienMegafauna=Defeated Alien Megafauna
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AccessAlienMegafauna=We have begun investigations of the dead titanic extraterrestrial beast.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AccessAlienMegafauna=Initial examination of the creature's colossal carcass suggests that it is not a wholly independent entity, but is instead linked to the plant-like alien growth around them. Think of that strange vegetation as akin to the vast fungal network that grows beneath fecund woodland soil, and of these titans as the mushrooms push through to the surface. There the analogy stops, however, for these giants are not fungal in nature, and they are of course ambulatory — and extremely aggressive.<br/><br/>Their true nature is something of a mystery, for they appear to be some hybridization of flesh and vegetation — quite possibly the result of genetic tampering. This is borne out by the staggering speed at which they reach their enormous size. Our current working hypothesis is that they do not simply "grow," but are themselves part of the aliens' terraforming procedures. Effectively, nearby matter — soil, bedrock, plant and animal life — is absorbed in bulk, then rapidly transformed into creature mass.<br/><br/>While we cannot yet divine the exact nature of this process, one thing is clear: if left unchecked, an insurmountable number of these titans would soon stalk the Earth.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AliensBombardEarth=Aliens Bombard Earth
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AliensBombardEarth=The visitors have launched an assault from Earth orbit.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AliensBombardEarth=Infiltration. Escalation. Now, devastation. Firing from within our orbit, the aliens have unleashed a ruinous assault upon a region of Earth. While their target was localized rather than global, the death toll will nevertheless be high, and every soul on Earth may wake each morning wondering if this day might be their last.<br/><br/>Faced with this demonstration of overwhelming extraterrestrial might, humanity is torn — more so than ever before — between submission, resistance or escape.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AliensLandArmy=Aliens Land Warship on Earth
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AliensLandArmy=An army of extraterrestrials have arrived on our world.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AliensLandArmy=The aliens appear to have moved to the next stage of their plan for Earth. This is no midnight visitation or surreptitious abduction: This is an open declaration that they are here, and they are powerful. We believe they are preparing to deploy an army of alien war machines -- our visitors having dispensed with all attempts at subterfuge, and arriving on Earth en masse, in plain sight and conspicuously well-armed. Whether this show of force is intended to be a deterrent or is but the vanguard of a full-scale invasion may well depend upon humanity's response to it. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AliensAttackInSpace=Aliens Attack in Space
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AliensAttackInSpace=The visitors have staged an assault upon a human structure in space.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AliensAttackInSpace=It is possible that the visitors did not expect humanity to leave the confines of our homeworld. It is equally possible that our rapid technological advancement is something they have encountered before, in battles fought against other species from other worlds, and they were entirely prepared for this eventuality. Whichever might prove to be true, the outcome is the same: They are clearly angered by humanity's presence in space, and have struck accordingly. Life beyond the bosom of Earth is a fragile, hard-won thing, and thus the alien assault has had tragic, devastating consequences.<br/><br/>Some feel this only proves that Earth cannot possibly hope to oppose these aliens. Others interpret it instead as proof that humanity cannot thrive as long as these extraterrestrials remain within our solar system. For now, only one thing is certain: no human target is beyond their reach. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.AlienMegafaunaSpawns=Alien Monsters
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Summary.AlienMegafaunaSpawns=A new, and enormous, species of extraterrestrial has been detected on Earth.
TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.Detail.AlienMegafaunaSpawns=Where previously the land altered by the alien visitors was almost eerily still, now mountainous and monstrous silhouettes move through the unearthly vegetation. There were, until now, still those who refuted the presence of extraterrestrial beings on our world, but the startling footage of these immense new entities is something to demolish the convictions of even the most staunch unbeliever.<br/><br/>Their titanic bulk blots out the light; the land trembles at their step. Trees and buildings are pushed aside as if they were tissue paper, or are uprooted by vast tendrils as if they were mere seedlings, and, even miles away, the very air seems to bend at their deafening cry. All the world knows it now: giants are among us.

TIObjectiveTemplate.MilestoneFulfilled.TutorialAssignMission=Assigned a mission

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialSelectCouncilor.ResistCouncil=During mission phase, select one of your Councilors
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialSelectCouncilor.ResistCouncil=Run the game clock forward until the next mission phase triggers. Then, select one of your councilors on Earth's geoscape.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialSelectMission.ResistCouncil=Select a Councilor mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialSelectMission.ResistCouncil=Select a mission to perform from the list at the bottom center of the interface and click on an appropriate target in the geoscape.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialUseMissionSlider.ResistCouncil=Use the resource slider on a Councilor Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialUseMissionSlider.ResistCouncil=If the mission is contested, you may spend resources to improve your chance of success using the slider.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignMission.ResistCouncil=Assign Councilors to Missions
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignMission.ResistCouncil=After all councilors have been assigned missions select the Confirm Assignments button.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialAssignMission.ResistCouncil=Councilor <h>missions</h> are the primary way to expand your reach on Earth. Twice a month, the game will enter the <h>mission phase</h>, during which all factions will assign their councilors to missions. Missions may target nations, control points, space facilities, and other councilors.<br/><br/>Missions will be resolved in a set sequence in the weeks between mission phases. Defensive missions will trigger before missions that are offensive in nature. While some missions are automatically successful, many are contested and require a success roll.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialAssignMission.ResistCouncil=You will be able to assign your councilors to new missions at the beginning of each mission phase, which occurs weekly and will slow down to twice per month as the game progresses.<br/><br/><h>You may want to increase the game speed using the controls in the top right.</h>


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialSetResearchPriority.ResistCouncil=Set a Research Priority
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialSetResearchPriority.ResistCouncil=Go to the Research screen and change the priority settings for one of the public research or faction engineering projects by clicking on the cycler for a technology or project you wish to complete.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialSetResearchPriority.ResistCouncil=Research in Terra Invicta is divided into two categories: public research and faction engineering. All factions may contribute to up to three simultaneous public research projects, which represent a global move forward in the understanding of broad scientific principles. <h>The faction that contributes the most to a particular public research project selects the next public project for the world to pursue.</h><br/><br/>Faction engineering projects are conducted privately and typically confer a concrete benefit.<br/><br/>Each faction distributes its research income among the public and private projects. While putting all research into a single area may see it completed sooner, this will forgo many faction bonuses tied to particular areas of research.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialSetResearchPriority.ResistCouncil=Contributing to global tech research will increase your chances of unlocking private faction projects to research. Certain Hab modules and orgs will allow you to pursue multiple private projects at once.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialSelectProject.ResistCouncil=Select a Project
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialSelectProject.ResistCouncil=Select a new project for your faction to research.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignControlNationMission.ResistCouncil=Assign a Councilor to a Control Nation Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignControlNationMission.ResistCouncil=Send a councilor to a nation you wish to gain a foothold in. Select a councilor and then select the "Control Nation" mission from the mission list at the bottom center of the interface.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialGainControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Gain a Control Point in a Nation
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialGainControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Upon successful resolution of a "Control Nation" mission, you will gain a control point in that nation.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialGainControlPoint.ResistCouncil=<h>Control Points</h> represent key nodes of political and economic power in a nation. They grant access to the nation's resources, control over its funding priorities, and in some cases command of an Army.<br/><br/>Each nation has between one and six control points; the number corresponds with the size of the nation's economy.<br/><br/>Initially all control points are neutral, but expect all factions to target them early in the campaign. Neutral control points may be acquired by the "Gain Control" councilor mission, while the "Purge" mission seizes control points from other factions. Control points in more powerful nations will be harder to acquire in all cases.<br/><br/>The rightmost control point in a nation, called the executive control point, also grants access to the Set Policy mission, which allows initiating wars, forming alliances and similar high-level national actions.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialGainControlPoint.ResistCouncil=We have gained our first control point. This gives us access to some of the nation's resources, control over the nation's priorities, and possibly an army. Control points may be attacked by other factions via the Crackdown and Purge missions, so it may be wise to use the Defend Interests mission in this nation to discourage this behavior. 


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialCheckNationalPriority.ResistCouncil=Change a Nation's Priorities
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialCheckNationalPriority.ResistCouncil=Select a Nation and then in the Nation's Info Panel, Select the Priorities Button to open the Priorities Tab. Then adjust one of the nation's priorites by clicking the pips associated with it.  
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialCheckNationalPriority.ResistCouncil=A Nation's Priorities determine how it will distribute it's economic surplus over time in the form of <h>Investment Points</h>. Priorities determine much about a nation's growth. A few examples include: the building of armies, investment in education, and developing a space program. Having Control Points in a nation allows us to direct a Nation's Priorities. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialCheckNationalPriority.ResistCouncil=Directing the Priorities of Nations under our control as well as keeping tabs on the development of Nations under our opponents's control will be critical in our efforts to meet the alien threat. <br/><br/>Take a moment to consider how you would like the nations under our control to grow. Perhaps some can focus on developing <h>Mission Control</h> for our space assets. Others could focus on increasing their <h>Science</h> output so we can research new technologies faster. A few could focus on <h>Military Technology</h> so we are prepared if we need to face the aliens directly. <br/><br/>If we want stable nations ready to face the alien threat; we should move to keep <h>Cohesion</h> from dropping too low; keep <h>Unrest</h> from increasing; and make sure <h>Inequality</h> does not get out of hand. 


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignPublicCampaign.ResistCouncil=Assign a councilor to a Public Campaign Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignPublicCampaign.ResistCouncil=The larger a Nation's economy the harder it will be to perform most missions in that Nation. This can be midigated if we have <h>public opinion</h> is on our side. Use Public Campaign missions to sway <h>public opinion</h> toward us. Having a high level of public support increases success chances for missions carried out in that Nation such as the Control Nation mission.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialTakeOverAdjacentControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Take over a neigboring Control Point
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialTakeOverAdjacentControlPoint.ResistCouncil=It is easier to take over Control Points in nations that neighbor nations that you control. Use the Control Nation mission to take over neighboring Control Points.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialTakeOverFederationControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Take over a Control Point in the same Federation
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialTakeOverFederationControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Another way to increase the success of a Control Nation mission is to own Control Points in nations that are in the same Federation.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialGainLargeNationControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Gain a Control Point in a Large Nation
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialGainLargeNationControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Successfuly carry out a Control Nation mission in a Nation with at least five Control Points.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialGainLargeNationControlPoint.ResistCouncil=While we should pursue a diverse coalition of support. If we are to meaningfully face the potential threat posed by the aliens, we will need the backing of some Nations with significant resources. We should align ourselves with Nations that are generating <h>boost</h> or have the resources to bootstrap a space program within a short period of time so that if necessary we can meet whatever threat these aliens pose on an even footing. Additionally, we should consider Nations that have access to an <h>army</h> or could field one if the aliens reveal terrestrial hostile intent.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialGainLargeNationControlPoint.ResistCouncil=We now have a foothold in a large Nation and are on our way towards building a solid foundation of support for our cause. We should now set our sights on gaining control of the <h>Executive Control Point</h> which would allow us to set this Nation's <h>National Policy</h>.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialGainLargeNationExecutiveControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Gain the Executive Control Point in a Large Nation
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialGainLargeNationExecutiveControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Successfuly carry out a Control Nation mission on the Executive Control Point in a Nation with at least five Control Points.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialGainLargeNationExecutiveControlPoint.ResistCouncil=Now that we have a foothold in a Large Nation we should move to cement our position by taking over the <h>Executive Control Point</h>. Continue to run Control Nation missions in a Large Nation until we have taken over the Executive Control Point.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialGainLargeNationExecutiveControlPoint.ResistCouncil=We are now in control of this nation's executive branch. This allows us to use the <h>Set National Policy</h> mission on this nation, we also gain access to this nation's nuclear arsenal if it has one. <br/><br/><h>Set National Policy</h> is a powerful mission, to name a few examples, we can use it to disarm nukes, disband armies, and change alliances. After selecting a nation, hover over the National Policies Icon in the Overview portion of the Nation Info Panel to see what policies are available. <br/><br/>We have heavily invested ourselves in this nation and our opponents could severely hamper out efforts if they attacked us here. Control points may be attacked by other factions via the Crackdown and Purge missions, use the <h>Defend Interests</h> mission in this nation to counter their efforts.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialRecruitCouncilor3.ResistCouncil=Recruit a 3rd Councilor
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialRecruitCouncilor3.ResistCouncil=Recruit and maintain 3 councilors in your council.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialRecruitCouncilor4.ResistCouncil=Recruit a 4th Councilor
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialRecruitCouncilor4.ResistCouncil=Recruit and maintain 4 councilors in your council.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchWeAreNotAlone.ResistCouncil=Research We Are Not Alone
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchWeAreNotAlone.ResistCouncil=Research the global technology We Are Not Alone. This technology is a prerequisite for the Clandestine Cells project. Once the research is complete the Clandestine Cells project will become available after some time.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchClandestineCells.ResistCouncil=Research Clandestine Cells
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchClandestineCells.ResistCouncil=Research the Clandestine Cells project once it becomes available. This project allows you to recruit a 5th councilor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialBuildCouncil.ResistCouncil=Build your Council
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialBuildCouncil.ResistCouncil=Recruit and maintain 5 councilors in your council.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialBuildCouncil.ResistCouncil=Your faction council is the backbone of your political efforts on Earth, and growing your council will allow you to undertake more missions each month. Councilors have a variety of attributes, backgrounds, available missions and traits. Building a council that can handle a variety of tasks will help you keep pace with the other factions.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialBuildCouncil.ResistCouncil=Make sure you recruit several councilors with the ability to gain control points in nations. Councilors whose professions have an affinity to your faction's goals will cost less influence to recruit.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialPurchaseOrg.ResistCouncil=Acquire an Org
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialPurchaseOrg.ResistCouncil=Go to the Council screen, select one of your councilors, and acquire an org from the org marketplace by dropping its icon into your orgs window and paying the cost.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialUnequipOrg.ResistCouncil=Unequip an Org from a Councilor
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialUnequipOrg.ResistCouncil=In the Council screen, select one of your councilors with an org, then switch the org tab to faction orgs. Now right-click or drag the equipped org into the faction pool to unequip the org from your councilor. This will allow you to equip the org to another councilor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialEquipOrg.ResistCouncil=Managing Orgs
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialEquipOrg.ResistCouncil=In the council screen select one of your councilors, then right-click or drag an org from your faction pool to equip the org.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialEquipOrg.ResistCouncil=Organizations, or orgs, are government agencies, NGOs, criminal organizations, and private companies under the control of one of our councilors. Orgs provide stat bonuses, incomes, missions, bonuses to research, and bonuses to certain priorities for nations under your control.<br/><br/>These are acquired with money, influence and rarely ops (typically for criminal cartels). Some orgs are available to councilors with certain traits or of a certain nationality.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialEquipOrg.ResistCouncil=Unpurchased orgs will sometimes be made available to other factions after a certain period. You may also develop orgs via faction projects and transfer orgs between councilors at a small cost.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignCrackdown.ResistCouncil=Assign a councilor to a Crackdown Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignCrackdown.ResistCouncil=Use Crackdown missions on enemy controlled nations to weaken the control points, increasing the success chance for purge missions.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignPurge.ResistCouncil=Assign a Councilor to a Purge Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignPurge.ResistCouncil=Use Purge Missions on enemy CPs to take control of them from an enemy Faction. It is highly recommended to use Crackdown first to disable any benefits and increase the success chance.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialAssignPurge.ResistCouncil=Controlling nations is vital to establishing a foothold and increasing your research and resources so you can venture into the solar system. Sometimes an enemy Faction may control CPs in a nation you seek to control. In order to gain control of CPs already in control of another faction, you must send your Councilors on Crackdown and Purge Missions. Crackdown will weaken the CP. Follow up with Purge to steal the CP for your Faction.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialAssignPurge.ResistCouncil=Purging enemy CPs is a valuable tool in your arsenal. Keep an eye out for undefended enemy CPs, which are ripe for the taking.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignDefendInterests.ResistCouncil=Assign a Councilor to a Defend Interests Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignDefendInterests.ResistCouncil=Use Defend Interests on Nations with CPs under your control to protect them from enemy Councilor missions. Hostile missions are much less likely to succeed on defended CPs.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialAssignDefendInterests.ResistCouncil=Defend Interests is a useful defensive tool to prevent enemy Factions from successfully completing Crackdown, Purge, and Coup missions. It is highly recommended to defend your most valuable Nations. Its protections will expire and must be renewed periodically.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialAssignDefendInterests.ResistCouncil=Use Defend Interests to protect your valuable Nations against enemy Crackdown, Purge, and Coup missions.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignIncreaseUnrest.ResistCouncil=Assign a councilor to an Increase Unrest Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignIncreaseUnrest.ResistCouncil=Use the Increase Unrest mission to weaken the targeted nation's economy, making Coups, revolutions, and secessions more likely to succeed.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialAssignCoup.ResistCouncil=Assign a Councilor to a Coup Mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialAssignCoup.ResistCouncil=Send your councilor on a Coup Mission in a nation controlled by another Faction. A successful Coup will overthrow the government and reset all CPs.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialAssignCoup.ResistCouncil=Coups are used to reset CPs in an enemy controlled Nation. Coups are more likely to succeed in Nations with high Unrest. Use the Increase Unrest mission prior to attempting the Coup.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialAssignCoup.ResistCouncil=Use Increase Unrest to weaken an enemy Nation's economy, followed by a Coup to overthrow the government and reset the nation's CPs.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialFoundStation.ResistCouncil=Found a Station
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialFoundStation.ResistCouncil=Space Stations or "Platforms" are humanity's foothold in outer space, and critical to industrializing space and building a war fleet. Stations are composed of modules that grant bonuses to research and other resources and allow construction of ships and additional modules. We should start stockpiling <h>boost</h> and a couple points of <h>mission control</h> in preperation for founding a station. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialFoundStation.ResistCouncil=Save sufficient money, boost, and mission control to afford to launch a platform core module. Then zoom out on Earth to a distance that the nation boundaries are no longer visible and click the planet. From the icons at the bottom of the screen, select the "Found Platform" icon. Select an orbit around Earth in which the station will reside, and confirm by clicking the Found Platform button.<br/><br/><h>It may take several months to be ready to accomplish this.</h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialFoundStation.ResistCouncil=Stations will become more and more critical to our efforts. When you are ready consider developing larger stations by researching the Orbitals Tech. To build stations further away from Earth we will need to complete the "Mission to ..." public research projects. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialBuildStationPower.ResistCouncil=Build a Solar Collector
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialBuildStationPower.ResistCouncil=Our new station can support four modules. Getting some labs modules up and running will help support our efforts to organize an effective resistance to the aliens. However, modules require power to operate. We are going to need a power generation solution for our station.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialBuildStationPower.ResistCouncil=From the Habs Screen select your station, then select the "Manage" button. Click and Drag a Solar Collector into one of the station's four module slots.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialBuildStationPower.ResistCouncil=With the Solar Collector in construction, our station will soon be powered. Solar Collectors work more efficiently the closer they are to the Sun. We will have to find other means of power generation if we are to operate effectively in the outer planets. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialBuildStationLab.ResistCouncil=Build a Lab
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialBuildStationLab.ResistCouncil=Now that our station will be powered, we can build a lab. Labs provide a diverse set of bonues, typically to the body they orbit. Choose from our available labs or research a new lab faction engineering project to unlock a new lab. Then build a lab on our station. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialBuildStationLab.ResistCouncil=From the Habs Screen select your station, then select the "Manage" button. Click and Drag a Lab into one of the station's four module slots.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialBuildStationLab.ResistCouncil=Once our lab is complete this station will lend support to our efforts to resist the aliens on Earth and beyond. In the future we will need to expand our stations capabilites to support more than four modules. To do so we will need to Research the "Orbitals" Tech and then complete the "Orbital Core" project.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchMissionToMoonMars.ResistCouncil=Research the Mission to the Moon or Mission to Mars techs.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchMissionToMoonMars.ResistCouncil=Researching the "Mission to ..." technologies will unlock the operation to send probes to the respective space bodies.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialProbeSpaceBody.ResistCouncil=Launch a Probe
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialProbeSpaceBody.ResistCouncil=For the moment our material needs for our space assets are being provided by our launch facilites on Earth. <h>This strains our boost income.</h> We will have to expand our operations across the solar system to alleviate this and build a strong interplanetary economy. The first step to constructing bases on other planets, moons, and asteroids is to launch probes to assess various sites on those bodies. Probes may be launched from Earth or from habitats with a space dock or larger spacecraft construction module.<br/><br/>Once a probe arrives at a space body, each site's mining data will be visible.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialProbeSpaceBody.ResistCouncil=Select a space body within range, select the probe operation to target it, and confirm the launch.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialProbeSpaceBody.ResistCouncil=The probe will take some time to get to its destination. Once it does, you may found a base there once you have developed the appropriate technologies.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchMissionToSpace.ResistCouncil=Research Mission to Space Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchMissionToSpace.ResistCouncil=Research the Mission to Space Technology.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchOutpostHabs.ResistCouncil=Research the Outpost Habs Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchOutpostHabs.ResistCouncil=Research the Outpost Habs Technology.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchOutpostCore.ResistCouncil=Research the Outpost Core Project
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchOutpostCore.ResistCouncil=Research the Outpost Core Project, which will allow you to found outposts.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialFoundBase.ResistCouncil=Found a Base
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialFoundBase.ResistCouncil=Accumulate sufficient resources to found a base, then select a space body you have previously sent a probe to, select a site for the base, and confirm the operation.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialFoundBase.ResistCouncil=Like stations, bases are built out of modules that confer a variety of benefits, but they may also host a mining complex, which can provide space resources to other habs via an electromagnetic catapult. Having a network of mines outside Earth's gravity well will reduce your reliance on the scarce Boost resource and help you grow your space industry rapidly.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialFoundBase.ResistCouncil=To build a mining complex, support the development of the Advanced Magnetics, Mass Drivers, and Space Mining and Refining public technologies.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchSpaceMining.ResistCouncil=Research the Space Mining and Refining Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchSpaceMining.ResistCouncil=Research the Space Mining and Refining Technology.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchOutpostMining.ResistCouncil=Research the Outpost Mining Complex Project
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchOutpostMining.ResistCouncil=Research the Outpost Mining Complex Project, which will allow you to build mining modules on Bases.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialBuildMine.ResistCouncil=Build a Mine at one of your Bases
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialBuildMine.ResistCouncil=Accumulate sufficient resources to build a mine, then select one of your Bases in the Hab screen and start the construction of a mine.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialBuildMine.ResistCouncil= Mines are essential for gathering space resources.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialBuildMine.ResistCouncil=Mining complexes are your primary means of acquiring space resources which are used for building your fleets. Continue prospecting space bodies and establishing mines throughout the solar system.


TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialBuildHab.ResistCouncil=Build a Space Station
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialBuildHab.ResistCouncil=Build a Space Station, which is the first step to constructing ships.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchOrbitalShipbuilding.ResistCouncil=Research the Orbital Shipbuilding Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchOrbitalShipbuilding.ResistCouncil=Research the Orbital Shipbuilding Technology.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchSpaceDock.ResistCouncil=Research the Space Dock Project
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchSpaceDock.ResistCouncil=Research the Space Dock Project. Space Docks unlock construction on Space Stations.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialResearchInterplanetaryWarships.ResistCouncil=Research the Interplanetary Warships Project
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialResearchInterplanetaryWarships.ResistCouncil=Research the Interplanetary Warships Project. Interplanetary Warships allows you to design and construct gunship, escort, and corvette class ships.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialSpaceDock.ResistCouncil=Construct a Space Dock Module
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialSpaceDock.ResistCouncil=Construct a Space Dock Module. Stations require a Space Dock Module to construct ships. Construct a Space Dock on one of your Stations.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialDesignShip.ResistCouncil=Design a Ship Template
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialDesignShip.ResistCouncil=Go the Fleets Screen and click on the Design Ship Class button. Follow the Ship Designer tutorial and complete a Ship Design, and once you are happy with the Design, save the template so it can be used to construct a ship.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.TutorialBuildShip.ResistCouncil=Build a Ship
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.TutorialBuildShip.ResistCouncil=In the Fleets screen, use the ship construction screen to order a specific ship's construction using a template you have created.
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.TutorialBuildShip.ResistCouncil=The war against the aliens can't be won on Earth alone. We need to develop the technologies to fight them in space as well. Constructing warships at our habs is an expensive and challenging task and we will need significant space-based industry to support it.<br/><br/><h>This may take several years to accomplish.</h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.TutorialBuildShip.ResistCouncil=Fleets can occupy orbits or dock at habs. To intercept another fleet, use the "Transfer" operation, but make sure you have sufficient Delta-V to reach the target and get to a resupply base.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.HumanGeneralEarth=Control Earth's Nations
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.HumanGeneralEarth=Amid the uncertainty about the arrival of the aliens, we have an opportunity to establish ourselves as an important power on the global stage. We must connect with like-minded officials in government and industry and begin quietly marshaling Earth's resources to address whatever plans the aliens may have. We must become the power behind the throne in many of Earth's nations to build an international alliance that will advance our objectives.<br/><br/>To that end, our first priority should be to send our councilors to gain control points in nations with strong economies, militaries and research and space programs, and initiating public campaigns where necessary to sway the public to our cause.<br/><br/>Much of Earth's economy is wasted on "spoils" — people enriching themselves at others' expense; with sufficient control, we can reorient those nations to serve more productive ends.<br/><br/>We are aware of other transnational groups like ours forming, and it may become necessary to oppose them directly if they turn too many nations to their ideology.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.HumanGeneralEarth=Have your councilors conduct Control Nation, Purge, Coup and Unrest missions to gain Control Points in Earth's nations. If necessary, employ armies to invade enemy nations and impose regimes allied to our cause. Set the priorities of those nations to develop space and research programs, improve stability and economic output, and to field defenses against our rivals. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.HumanGeneralSpace=Industrialize Space
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.HumanGeneralSpace=The alien arrival via a small spacecraft, along with additional sightings of suspected alien craft in our Solar System, tell us that the coming conflicts will depend on space power — of which the Earth has almost none. Using what national and private resources we can align to our cause, we should develop an industrial base away from Earth — stations and eventually bases that can contribute to the construction of a war fleet.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.HumanGeneralSpace=Stockpile the Boost and Mission Control resources and use them to construct and manage industrial and research habs in locations our current technology allows.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.HumanGeneralCouncil=Build the Council
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.HumanGeneralCouncil=Our councilors will form the backbone of our efforts on Earth. We must recruit a diverse, influential and loyal group of supporters to accomplish missions around the world. Councilors with high persuasion and the Control Nation mission will be particularly useful early in our campaign.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.HumanGeneralCouncil=Spend Influence to recruit councilors with attributes and missions that best advance our cause. Acquire orgs that improve their capabilities.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ResistCouncil=Investigate Alien Crash
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ResistCouncil=Our first knowledge of the alien arrival came when its spacecraft aerobraked in our upper atmosphere before crashing down in a remote territory and apparently self-destructing. We should send a councilor to the site to learn what we can.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ResistCouncil=Have a councilor conduct the Investigate Alien Activity mission at the crash site.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ResistCouncil=Despite heavy security, we were able to obtain some surveillance records of the crash site, as well as a small quantity of debris. We should have a project ready for research shortly.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ResistCouncil=We have found something, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirSignatures.ResistCouncil=Research Alien Signatures
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirSignatures.ResistCouncil=Our councilor was able to obtain some surveillance recordings from the alien crash site. Our researchers should analyze it as soon as possible.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirSignatures.ResistCouncil=When it becomes available, complete the "Alien Signatures" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirSignatures.ResistCouncil=Our studies of the crash site have determined that a motile, sapient life form survived the crashdown and moved with purpose into the nearby wilderness. We have no footage of the creature, nor any further sighting reports. Worryingly, however, we are receiving reports of strange occurrences in nearby communities, including disappearances of both animals and people. So far we have no hard evidence that these events are related to the alien arrival, but should our agents detect concrete evidence of abductions, we should investigate immediately.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirSignatures.ResistCouncil=Commander, we appear to have an alien on the loose.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ResistCouncil=Investigate Alien Abductions
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ResistCouncil=Reports are continuing to surface of missing animals and people in the regions near the alien crash site. Using the Surveil Location mission in those regions will help us detect those events. When we confirm such a report, we should investigate it for any signs of alien activity. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ResistCouncil=Conduct Surveil Location missions in regions near any alien crash sites. If abductions are detected, send a councilor on an Investigate Alien Activity mission to that location.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ResistCouncil=Our councilor has investigated some of these reported abductions, interviewing residents and local authorities. The local government continues to deny that anything has happened, and in fact has done its best to actively hinder us. Though we have no proof as yet, we suspect that other organizations are pulling strings to block our investigations.<br/><br/>Despite the obstacles, our councilor has confirmed that a small but statistically significant number of people and animals have gone missing in the area since the alien crash-landing. This is disturbing news – many among our faction had clung to the hope that despite their secrecy, the intentions of the aliens towards our species might be benevolent, or at least neutral. These apparent abductions leave little chance of that. But what is their purpose?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ResistCouncil=The alien is taking people, Commander. We need to learn why.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMethods.ResistCouncil=Research Alien Methods
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMethods.ResistCouncil=All evidence suggests that the aliens are abducting human subjects. But why? Are they trying to communicate? Studying us? Hunting us? Or do they have some other purpose, something so truly alien that it is wholly beyond our understanding? We have many questions and few answers.<br/><br/>For now, all we have to go on is the abductions themselves. Our analysts have proposed a more detailed study of the abduction data, in the hope of discovering some patterns or avenues of research.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMethods.ResistCouncil=Research the "Alien Methods" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMethods.ResistCouncil=The earliest disappearances were limited to lower-order mammals, unremarkable if not for their frequency. The first confirmed human abductions occurred within 14 days of the crash; since then, they have steadily grown in number. The initial victims were primarily from rural areas and appeared to have been selected semi-randomly, with little in common but for their location. The second wave of disappearances, however, contained a disproportionate number of individuals of high socio-economic status – police chiefs, wealthy business owners, local legislators, etc. The pattern suggests the alien arrived on Earth with a plan in mind for establishing influence, and that it proceeded to adapt its tactics first to our local ecology, and then to our social structure.<br/><br/>That indicates there is no hope that our visitor's intentions are peaceful. From now on, we must act on the assumption that we are at war. As news of these abductions continues to spread, others are likely to draw the same conclusion.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMethods.ResistCouncil=Commander, we know the alien didn't come in peace.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ResistCouncil=Investigate Returned Abductees
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ResistCouncil=We have strange news. First one, then several of the missing humans have resurfaced. While their families are naturally relieved, it is hard to see why the aliens are acting in this way. Why go to so much effort to abduct human victims, then simply release them unharmed? Until we know more, I recommend that we send councilors to regions of suspected alien activity, and place all returned abductees under immediate surveillance. If these individuals have some part in the aliens' plan, we need to learn more ... and quickly.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ResistCouncil=Perform Surveil Location missions in areas with a suspected alien presence. Send councilors on Investigate Alien Activity missions when you discover evidence of alien influence on the populace or leaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ResistCouncil=We have news. It is not good news.<br/><br/>Two weeks ago, the son of a senior diplomat in one of our targeted regions disappeared after leaving a party at a remote farm late one night. He reappeared 36 hours later, offering no explanation for his absence. His mother was of course overjoyed at her son's return, but was surprised when he proceeded to take a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in her political ties. One of our field teams received the report and placed the teenager under round-the-clock surveillance.<br/><br/>A few days ago, our team followed the teenager to a derelict industrial park where they observed him placing a small package in a dead-drop location. Our team moved in, confiscated the package, and detained the teenager. Upon opening the package we discovered dossiers of information on various local political figures of national and international importance. The teenager offered no explanation for his behavior.<br/><br/>This does not appear to be an isolated incident. Several of our other field teams have reported abductees behaving in a similarly suspicious manner, again with no apparent explanation. Although it is dangerous to draw conclusions too swiftly, our working theory is that the aliens are somehow exerting influence over humans they come into contact with, and using these thralls to gather information on human institutions and power structures with a view towards establishing control. If this is true, the aliens are not only clandestinely moving against us, but may already be deep inside our society. We need to know more, and quickly.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ResistCouncil=Commander, we have learned something terrifying.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOperations.ResistCouncil=Research Alien Operations
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOperations.ResistCouncil=We have now received dozens of similar reports of strange behavior among returned abductees. More worrying still are early indications of shifts in governmental policy among nations with a high abduction rate. We recommend immediate analysis.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOperations.ResistCouncil=Research the "Alien Operations" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.ResistCouncil=The situation is worse than we had feared.<br/><br/>All of the countries with high abduction rates are now showing aberrant political trends. We have tracked rapid swings toward pro-alien views in ways that are extremely concentrated by geography, spreading in ways that more closely resemble infectious disease vectors than communications networks. These changes are being accompanied by sharp shifts in policy, with key officials and leaders either being replaced with pro-alien figures or – more disturbingly still – abruptly changing their beliefs and publicly expressing conciliatory views toward the alien presence on our planet. Multiple independent reports have noted sudden and uncharacteristic behavioral changes in these individuals, describing them as aloof, phlegmatic, and disinterested in any issues other than human-alien relations. None of our sources were able to offer any explanation for these changes.<br/><br/>In the absence of any real evidence, attempting to explain these developments is difficult. We have found ourselves falling back on theories drawn not from field reports, but from science fiction. At present, our best guesses are as follows.<br/><br/>1) The aliens are capable of mind control, perhaps via telepathy, a parasite, or some form of advanced technology.<br/>2) The aliens are replacing abductees, either directly (using some sophisticated method of disguise) or via clones.<br/><br/>Whatever the explanation, we must act quickly to attempt to slow the growth of their influence. Earth is engaged in a shadow war, and at present, the aliens are winning.<br/><br/><h>We have activated an alien threat monitor that estimates the likelihood they are going to target our intrests directly. It is visible in the top-right of the main game view.</h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOperations.ResistCouncil=We can only conclude we are at war, Commander, but most of humanity doesn't believe it yet.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMovements.ResistCouncil=Research Alien Movements
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMovements.ResistCouncil=Our long-range tracking technology has proven adequate for observing the stream of alien spacecraft moving around the Solar System. However, all of our attempts to track alien movements on Earth itself have so far ended in failure. To effectively counter the spread of alien influence, we need to be able to detect individual alien infiltrators here on the surface of our planet.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMovements.ResistCouncil=Research the "Alien Movements" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMovements.ResistCouncil=We have combined old-fashioned satellite coverage with some newly developed technology designed to detect aliens via their biological signatures. As more intelligence agencies and telecommunications companies join our cause, our tracking network is expanding to cover the entire globe. It's crude, and we're having to depend on a lot of people whom I don't trust very much, but if we're right, it'll give us the capability to track alien movements on Earth in real-time. Let's see if it works.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMovements.ResistCouncil=An important breakthrough, Commander. We can track them now.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOrigin.ResistCouncil=Research Alien Origin
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOrigin.ResistCouncil=Our research division has been studying the fragments of debris our councilor recovered from the crash site. The volume of material is very small, but our researchers have nevertheless drawn some important conclusions.<br/><br/>The debris is made of some kind of metallic alloy that is unusually hard and strong, with properties that do not fully match anything that human engineering can reproduce. Several of our researchers suspect that some fraction of the substance may be extrasolar in origin. However, we have definitely established that the majority of the mass in the debris bears the unique signatures of our Solar System's formation. In all likelihood, this ship was built somewhere within the orbit of our Sun.<br/><br/>If our analysis is correct, it suggests that the aliens have at least one base of operations within or very close to our Solar System. Locating it would be a valuable intelligence windfall.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOrigin.ResistCouncil=Research the Skywatch and Deep System Skywatch global technologies, and then the Alien Origin project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOrigin.ResistCouncil=We have significantly extended our abilities to watch and gather intelligence on the further reaches of our Solar System, and in the process we have discovered a number of alien "habs" – artificial habitats – in the Kuiper Belt. It seems our visitors have been here for some time.<br/><br/>Observation of the alien habs, along with re-examination of older telescope imagery taken before the alien arrival on Earth, has provided a much clearer picture of "local" alien operations. At some point in the last several years, the aliens built their habs and launched the ship that crashed down on Earth. Given that a) it seems impossible that complex life could have evolved in the frozen outer reaches of our Solar System, and b) the alien ship appears to be partially constructed from material of extrasolar origin, we believe that the aliens arrived here from another star system. We have three leading theories as to how they could have accomplished this.<br/><br/>1. They travelled to our Solar System via a slower-than-light interstellar spacecraft. Such a craft would in all probability be very large: it would require huge quantities of energy for propulsion and life support, and might well have taken generations to make the journey. We have thus far seen no evidence of such an alien "mothership".<br/>2. The aliens (or their ancestors) arrived long ago and have been recently awakened from hibernation, or they have been constructed somehow from raw materials. We currently have no explanation for how this might be possible.<br/>3. The aliens have developed some means of faster-than-light transport, such as an Alcubierre drive or traversable wormholes. While this theory might seem fanciful, the possibility of long-dormant aliens in the outermost regions of our solar system seems equally unlikely.<br/><br/>Our imagery analysts have also identified a structure on the alien surface base emitting highly unusual energy readings that do not appear to match any known form of power generation. Once again our research has left us with more questions than answers, but evidence suggests that the alien habs represent a key part of their logistics network. If we intend to oppose their operations, their habs should be a primary target.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOrigin.ResistCouncil=Commander, we've pinpointed their base in the Solar System.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.AccessHydraCorpus.ResistCouncil=Acquire an Alien Corpus
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.AccessHydraCorpus.ResistCouncil=We have learned all we can from remotely studying our enemy; to go further, we need an actual alien specimen. As yet, we have no idea how to protect ourselves from whatever mechanism the aliens use to enthrall humans, so our solution is to render the alien unable to enthrall us by killing it. A few of our researchers have objected to carrying out what amounts to an assassination mission, but – given how many humans have died in this conflict already – the majority of our personnel are less squeamish.<br/><br/>It is important, however, that we do not execute this operation in a casual manner. The aliens and their human allies have no doubt become aware of our efforts, and it seems likely we are inviting retaliatory strikes when we go forward. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.AccessHydraCorpus.ResistCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct an Assassinate mission against it. It is possible assaulting alien installations on Earth or in space may also yield an alien body for study, but it is difficult to predict under what circumstances that might occur.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.AccessHydraCorpus.ResistCouncil=We have acquired an alien corpse for study, though not without casualties of our own. The target alien was neutralized with minimal collateral damage, and the recovery team arrived within the allotted window. Unfortunately, during the process of securing the alien corpse for transport, it revived and attacked. The leader of the recovery team was killed by a single blow from one of the alien's upper appendages, and two more suffered serious injuries while attempting to flee. At this point our strike team re-engaged the alien, fired on it until it went down a second time, then continued firing into the body until they ran out of ammunition. Some cautious experiments led them to conclude that the alien was finally dead, at which point the body was recovered without further incident.<br/><br/>Shortly before he was killed, the recovery team leader, a biologist, said that the alien's facial structure reminded him of the microscopic organisms known as "hydras," which themselves are known to regenerate from injuries. In the absence of any other description for the invaders, the name has quickly proliferated throughout our research and operations divisions.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.AccessHydraCorpus.ResistCouncil=We've taken one down, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchHydraBiology.ResistCouncil=Research Hydra Biology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchHydraBiology.ResistCouncil=Our Xenobiology division is preparing to conduct an autopsy of the alien corpus. While the chief examiner is confident that no processes indicative of life or hibernation are present in the corpse, we have issued standing orders that an armed guard be present for all Hydra autopsies.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchHydraBiology.ResistCouncil=Research the "Hydra Biology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchHydraBiology.ResistCouncil=We have learned a great deal from studying the Hydra corpse. The alien's physiology exhibits a combined nervous and circulatory system, each Hydra possessing three heart/brain centers: one in the head, proximal to the topmost vertebrae, and two in the abdomen, at the right hypochondrium and the left iliac region. This redundant system means that barring catastrophic damage to more than one heart/nerve cluster, a Hydra can regenerate most of its functionality. Though the loss of one cluster is likely to limit higher cognitive function, an alien with two working clusters will still be able to perform basic to intermediate tasks.<br/><br/>The Hydras' regenerative capability appears to make the aliens largely unaffected by senescence. While they are not ageless, they seem capable of maintaining consistent fitness, mobility, and cognition for the majority of their natural lives, which our current estimates place at between 160 and 200 years. The tradeoff to being both long-lived and resilient is a complex physiology that is slow to develop and requires a great deal of energy. Hydra are nongendered at birth; each member of the species is born with latent male and female reproductive organs that do not fully develop until precipitated by specific conditions at a certain point in their life cycle. (Though not uncommon on Earth, sequential hermaphroditism is here only found in lower-order creatures such as fish, gastropods, and plants.) Hydras seem to only become sexual towards the end of their life cycle, and once sex assignment is complete there is no changing back. All of this implies a low birth rate.<br/><br/>We have also discovered something we believe to be more immediately relevant to our operations. While the clicking noises we recorded during the acquisition of this specimen are complex enough to be a language, we do not believe auditory communication to be the primary Hydra method of exchanging information. Instead, we have found the multi-tipped protuberance on their face and bulbs on the back of their neck to contain elaborate sensory organs that collect data from the air, and pass along that data to a hyper-developed vomeronasal organ, similar to how snakes use their tongues. The function of these Hydra organs appears to be communicative as well as sensory – they have the capability to rapidly construct and emit streams of cells which we have dubbed "pherocytes." These pherocytes can then be absorbed by other Hydras in turn.<br/><br/>The chemicals produced by the pherocytes can be highly complex, and we have discovered various compounds which our linguists have theorized may function as a kind of biological alphabet. This implies a bidirectional mechanism, something like pheromones, but via a living cell. However, the purpose of the pherocytes may go beyond communication. Some of the chemicals bear a resemblance to psychoactive drugs, with properties that suggest that they may have been specifically tailored to affect humans. Our science team strongly wishes to embark on a focused study of these pherocytes.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchHydraBiology.ResistCouncil=Our autopsy of the alien is complete, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocytes.ResistCouncil=Research Hydra Pherocytes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocytes.ResistCouncil=Over and over again, we have come back to the same question. How are the Hydras controlling their human servants? The Hydra pherocytes – these information-laden cells that the Hydras produce within their own bodies – may be the key. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocytes.ResistCouncil=Research the "Hydra Pherocytes" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocytes.ResistCouncil=Our suspicions are confirmed. The pherocytes are indeed the mechanism by which the Hydras control their servants.<br/><br/>The chemicals that Hydra pherocytes produce are incredibly potent, and seem specifically designed to affect humans, so much so that we now believe that the initial abductions must have been an alien research effort to develop them. Even momentary exposure can affect a recipient; longer exposure will quickly overwhelm them. Once ingested, the pherocytes make their way via mucous membrane to the region of the brain called the supra-marginal gyrus, the region of the parietal lobe that is responsible for human empathy. Once there, the pherocytes take up residence in the myelin sheath around the Nodes of Ranvier, where they regulate impulse conductivity. Influence increases until maximum saturation is reached, at which point additional exposure has no further effect.<br/><br/>The pherocytes have a limited lifespan. As they die off, and in the absence of a "top up", the subject gradually regains its sense of self-determination. This process is slow, less like awakening from sleep and more like gradually coming to terms with a new perspective. This gives us a slow, but reliable, method of treating returned abductees and Hydra servants from now on. Unfortunately we have yet to discover any method of expelling pherocytes from a human body directly. We have, however, confirmed that pherocyte exposure can be prevented by basic air filtration systems. All of our personnel will be issued with such gear on future operations.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocytes.ResistCouncil=We are learning how the Hydras control our people's minds, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienContainment.ResistCouncil=Research Hydra Containment
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienContainment.ResistCouncil=We are coming to the end of what we can learn from Hydra autopsies. The next step is to take one alive, which requires us to construct a containment facility. With our new understanding of Hydra pherocytes, this should be well within our capabilities. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienContainment.ResistCouncil=Research the "Hydra Containment" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienContainment.ResistCouncil=The facility is complete and testing is underway. We already have plans for what a larger facility could look like using this one as a blueprint; for now, we are confident this containment unit will serve to house a single captive Hydra. All that remains is to find our tenant.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienContainment.ResistCouncil=We are ready to do some alien abductions of our own, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.CaptureAHydra.ResistCouncil=Capture a Live Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.CaptureAHydra.ResistCouncil=The containment facility is prepared and capture teams are ready to move on your order as soon as we find a viable target. The Hydras have captured more than enough humans; we believe it is time for us to do the same to one of them in return.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.CaptureAHydra.ResistCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct a Detain mission against it. It may also be possible to locate an Alien Facility in an Earth region and conduct an Assault Alien Asset mission against it or detect and capture an alien hab out in the Solar System.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.CaptureAHydra.ResistCouncil=The operation was a success! Our capture team identified their target and fought a chaotic but ultimately successful engagement that ended when they inflicted targeted injuries to disable the Hydra while avoiding its three major nerve/heart clusters. As a precaution against pherocyte exposure, we are quarantining three team members whose suits tore during the mission, but the capture operation was completed without fatalities. We are one step closer to our goal.<br/><br/>The Hydra has been moved into our containment facility. It is still recovering from its injuries but our observers report they can already see signs of regeneration. They will let us know once it regains consciousness.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.ResistCouncil=Communicate with captured Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.ResistCouncil=We have been aware for some time that communicating with the aliens will be a challenge. A team of linguists have been working on the problem, and they believe they have developed a baseline vocabulary that would, if our theories are correct, allow us to communicate with the captured Hydra via a combination of chemical and auditory means. They are requesting priority access to the containment facility to complete their research.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.ResistCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.ResistCouncil=The linguists have compiled enough data from the captive to establish a sort of Hydran Rosetta Stone. By listening to the alien's clicking noises, comparing to every recorded instance of alien audio we have, and measuring it against the filtration readouts, the team believes their system is 70-80 percent accurate. The process still needs refinement, but it should be enough to conduct a crude interrogation of our captive Hydra.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while we can approximate the auditory component of the Hydra language, the emotion and meaning conveyed by the Hydra pherocytes have proven far more difficult to translate. Subtleties in the Hydra's communications will probably be lost, and we may struggle to convey our own intentions in any great detail. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.ResistCouncil=Commander, we're finally getting somewhere with our captive.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Salvage Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=The more we learn about the aliens, the more our science teams are coming to feel that we are not as behind technologically as we initially feared. The alien designs are far more advanced than ours, and their materials science is particularly impressive, but the alien equipment seems for the most part compatible with our own scientific understanding. If we can gain access to some working examples of alien technology, our research division believes that they should be able to reverse-engineer them. I recommend you select a small and vulnerable alien target that we can swiftly overwhelm, enabling us to loot the field and withdraw before the aliens can respond. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Successfully engage one of the following alien assets: facility, landed UFO, habitat, warship, or army.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Congratulations on your military success. The recovered alien artifacts have been secured and cataloged.<br/><br/>The collective response from our researchers has been ecstatic. Dr Dennet Black, one of our energy physicists, has claimed that his team will eventually be able to build "a reactor like nothing in human history." Though we still have a long road ahead of us, this does feel like cause for celebration – the secrets within these artifacts carry the potential to massively jump-start our scientific development. It is a crucial first step towards being capable of fighting the aliens on an equal footing. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=You'll want to look at what our team has brought home, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Research Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Our research teams are clamoring to study the recovered alien technology. We hope to not only significantly enhance our own studies, but also to come to better understand our invaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Research the "Alien Technology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=Our research has been fruitful.<br/><br/>First, we have confirmed that all of the pieces of alien equipment we have thus far examined were constructed primarily out of elements and materials found in our Solar System. This is perhaps unsurprising; considering the massive energies required to traverse the vast distances between stars, it is logical that an interstellar invader would seek to rely on a defender's resources rather than haul their own. Second, and more importantly, every sample studied contains some trace of a unique, artificial alloy of extrasolar origin. From silver conduit wiring to steel struts, the alloy is as common in alien construction as it is nonexistent in our own. At present, the composition of this alloy is a mystery.<br/><br/>If we wish to continue to reverse-engineer alien technology, analyzing this alloy is the next step. All of our research thus far indicates that the aliens are heavily dependent on this substance – if we wish to gain any real understanding of their technology, we must understand this material first. Unfortunately, performing such an analysis will require a far larger quantity and variety of samples than we currently possess. We will have to acquire these alloys in bulk.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienTechnology.ResistCouncil=I have a progress report, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienWarship.ResistCouncil=Salvage Alien Warship
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienWarship.ResistCouncil=For our research to progress, we require a large quantity of alien alloys. Preliminary analysis suggests that the only alien vehicles that contain these alloys in sufficient volume are their warships – we had at first entertained hopes of capturing a transport ship of some kind, but should these exist, we have been unable to locate one. It is a warship or nothing, which means the time has come to strike back at the aliens in space.<br/><br/>This mission entails extreme risk. We still do not have a thorough grasp on alien tactics or doctrine, nor do we have an accurate estimate of their full naval capacity. In the absence of better intelligence, our recommendation is to ambush a lone vessel in the hope of quickly defeating it before any local alien forces can respond. A full-scale fleet battle is not recommended.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienWarship.ResistCouncil=Engage and defeat an alien warship, then research the "Alien Warships" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienWarship.ResistCouncil=Our exposure to alien technology at the crash site did not prepare us for the sight of a true alien warship. Though the warship shares design similarities to their infiltration vessels, its scale is awe-inspiring. Even so, salvage teams reported a number of "humanizing" instances: hastily patched hull, jury-rigged conduits, and other field fixes. For all their technology, the aliens are still susceptible to equipment failure. They are not gods.<br/><br/>One detail that surprised us during our examination of the wreck was the absence of dead aliens. Upon further examination, we have concluded that despite its size, the warship appears to be manned by an extremely small crew. The ship is heavily automated, with the main function of its crew being to repair battle damage and keep systems online. Our working theory is that these crew were all working in priority-target systems during combat, and were vaporized or spaced when those systems were struck by our weapons.<br/><br/>Of course, the main purpose of this operation was not to gather intelligence, but to acquire alien alloys, a goal which I am pleased to say we have now accomplished. The same mysterious alloys that we have seen before are present in significant quantities throughout every system and structure of the warship, from the silver conduit wiring to its massive ablative armor plates. Shipments are already en route to our research division for analysis. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienWarship.ResistCouncil=Our forces have won a crucial victory, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExotics.ResistCouncil=Research Exotics
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExotics.ResistCouncil=We are finally in a position to research the extrasolar alien materials, which we have designated as "Exotics." The project may be a dangerous one, and though we have taken some precautions, the very nature of working with an unknown substance means we must accept certain risks. Despite the danger, we have no shortage of volunteers. The men and women who unlock the secrets of these materials will go down in the history books ... and in doing so, will finally give us the ability to match and overpower the aliens in space.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExotics.ResistCouncil=Research the "Exotic Materials" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExotics.ResistCouncil=Out of all the examples of alien technology we have had the opportunity to examine, their Exotics may be the most impressive. The material's actual composition, as well as its means of manufacture, is still a mystery – more than a few of our researchers have theorized that we may be looking at the first known samples of pico technology – but we have come to a basic understanding of how to use it. Our best approximation of its purpose is that it is designed to function as an kind of universal "enhancer" component that directly alters the physical properties of whatever material it bonds with.<br/><br/>The versatility of the alien Exotics is astonishing, and completely transforms our understanding of materials science. As an example, consider the engineering problem of conductivity. When designing electronics, the ideal is to use a material with as high a conductivity as possible, in order to reduce energy loss, waste heat, and lag in data transfer. Copper is our most commonly used conductive metal – silver conducts marginally better, but is far more expensive and has lower tensile strength. By alloying copper with Exotics, we have created a new compound which possesses higher conductivity than copper or silver ... in fact, higher than any known material originating on Earth. And this new compound achieves this without compromising its other properties – there is no trade-off!<br/><br/>Examining the warship's ablative armor tells a similar story. Our most common steel alloys boast tensile and yield strengths ranging from 1,200 to 1,800 megapascals, but a hardness of only 5.5 to 6.5 out of 10 on the Mohs scale. Conversely, our tungsten alloys can reach 9-9.5 Mohs, but often provide only 300-700 megapascals of yield and tensile strength. The alien armor is far superior to both, and our attempts to duplicate it by applying Exotics to our own alloying process have produced composite alloys that exhibit yield and tensile strength above those of steel alloys without sacrificing impact resistance. There is no field of engineering that these materials cannot revolutionize.<br/><br/>There is, however, a catch. Despite their best efforts, our researchers have made no progress whatsoever towards synthesizing Exotics ourselves – we believe its production requires advanced infrastructure which we have no means of duplicating. For the foreseeable future, our only way of obtaining it will be to steal or scavenge it from the aliens. It is a precious and limited resource that must be spent carefully.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExotics.ResistCouncil=We're starting to unlock the secrets of the alien materials, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchWormholes.ResistCouncil=Research Wormholes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchWormholes.ResistCouncil=Our captive made brief mention of a "gate" used by its species. This is evidence in support of the "wormhole theory" as to how the Hydras were able to make the journey across deep space. While a single remark from a single captive is not proof, many of our researchers are keen to begin exploring potential ways by which we might detect a stabilized wormhole joining our solar system to another. If such an object truly exists, it is in all likelihood the heart of the alien offensive against our world. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchWormholes.ResistCouncil=Complete the "Wormholes" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchWormholes.ResistCouncil=Our astrophysicists have taken advantage of our Deep Skywatch observatories, as well as some of the new technology available to us, to study the primary alien base in the Kuiper Belt. Their conclusions are unanimous: the Hydra base houses one end of a stable, traversable wormhole.<br/><br/>According to our researchers and the data our spacecraft have gathered over the course of this conflict, the alien wormhole can best be modelled as an Ellis Drainhole, a previously-theoretical mathematical construct consisting of a spatial discontinuity in which matter on one side of the wormhole "drains" into its destination. If our models are correct, this means that transporting mass to our solar system requires significantly less energy than sending anything back the other way. Our researchers theorize that the Hydras somehow moved the mouth of the wormhole from its origin in another solar system to here, perhaps by means of a probe or some other ship specialized for interstellar travel.<br/><br/>How the Hydra were able to create or move this wormhole is entirely unknown. We believe that Hydra Exotics were involved somehow – Skywatch observatories have confirmed a significant quantity of Exotics near the wormhole's location – but several of our astrophysicists have admitted that truly understanding the wormhole's creation would require a grasp of physics so far beyond our own that it would amount to a new sub-branch of science. In any case, we don't need to know how to make one, we only need to know how to stop it. We are not picking up any similar readings anywhere else, so for now, we are operating on the assumption that this is the only wormhole in our Solar System. If the aliens lose it, their war effort will be crippled.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchWormholes.ResistCouncil=Commander, we now know how they've come to our Solar System.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ResistCouncil=Research The Choke Point
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ResistCouncil=Now that we know that we are dealing with an Ellis Drainhole, our physicists and naval officers can work together to develop a plan to cut off the aliens from their source of resupply. We've requisitioned a meeting room and a lot of coffee. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ResistCouncil=Complete the "The Choke Point" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ResistCouncil=We have studied, discussed, and discarded over a dozen plans. Over time, however, a consensus emerged and we kept coming back to variations of the same two ideas. Seize the wormhole, or destroy it.<br/><br/>In the end, the deciding factor was risk. Seizing the wormhole would give us the greatest potential benefit, but also carries the greatest potential danger. We still have no real grasp of how the wormhole is generated, and we have no guarantee that we will be able to understand or operate the Hydra controls. Trying to take possession of it would likely leave us holding only one end of the wormhole, struggling to figure out how to control it, while the Hydras on the other end sent a limitless stream of slave reinforcements to attack us. Besides, in the final analysis, our mission is not to seize the Hydra's means of transport; it is to protect Earth. Closing the wormhole is the most reliable way to wreck the Hydra invasion for good.<br/><br/>Closing the wormhole, however, is easier said than done. The obvious solution is simply to bombard the alien base from range – unfortunately, our researchers believe that once the wormhole origin and destination were connected, the Hydras must have created some type of quantum "scaffolding" relying on Exotics to keep the gate open. If this is true, attacking one side of the wormhole will only cause the attack to "bounce" towards the opposite end. Even reducing the alien base and its astronomical body to space dust would not destroy the wormhole itself – it would inconvenience the Hydras, but our attack must be more than an inconvenience. We need to end this conflict in one decisive blow.<br/><br/>The solution that our researchers have come up with is to attack both sides at once, compressing the gate and forcing it to collapse. Success in this mission will require precise cooperation between our scientific and military arms. Our astrophysicists and engineers will develop two Exotics-based payloads, one for each side of the drain hole, with the intention of detonating them simultaneously. Meanwhile, we will assemble a heavily armed assault company tasked with escorting the payload operators and seizing and maintaining control over the wormhole. The entire unit will be formed of volunteers only. Realistically, we must expect that few of its members will be coming back.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ResistCouncil=Our mission is set, Commander. We must close the enemy's gate.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchResistVictory.ResistCouncil=Set Our Goals
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchResistVictory.ResistCouncil=We know now that the aliens are bent on infiltrating human institutions for their own ends, controlling individuals and entire societies to serve their own purposes. For some time now, debates and discussions have been taking place amongst our members as to what our response should be. It is easy to call ourselves the "Resistance", but what are we resisting, and how? 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchResistVictory.ResistCouncil=Complete the "Defend the Earth" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchResistVictory.ResistCouncil=Under the alien invasion, our world has fractured. Some parts of humanity have chosen to submit, aiming only to survive. Others have sought to take advantage of the situation to advance their own personal agendas. Others have decided that the only path to victory is to either destroy the aliens, or to turn the tables and enslave them in return. A common theme that we hear from all of them is a conviction that the old ways do not work; that to withstand this crisis, humanity must change and become something new.<br/><br/>We have chosen to reject this belief. We do not believe, as Humanity First do, that humanity must become violently xenophobic; nor do we agree with the Academy that we should sacrifice our lives to befriend a race of ruthless slavers. We do not think that human society needs to be remolded around corporations in the name of profit, nor that it needs to become a theocratic or totalitarian world government. We just want to be left the hell alone, and go back to living sane, normal lives in our home countries without the constant threat of alien invasions or coups or attempts at world conquest. The other factions – the Servants, the Protectorate, the Initiative – may disagree on almost everything, but in one important respect, they are all exactly the same. They're all lunatics with delusions of grandeur who think they know better than everyone else.<br/><br/>And so this is our decision. Our goal is not to change the world. Our goal is to stop the alien invasion, and nothing more. Human society will be transformed by this conflict – that is inevitable – but the nature of that transformation is a matter for individual countries to choose for themselves. If we can protect our world, and preserve the independence of our species, that is enough.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheFinalAssault.ResistCouncil=Prepare the Final Assault
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheFinalAssault.ResistCouncil=We have our fleet, and we have the strike team. Now we must develop a plan to close the wormhole and cut the alien invasion off from its source of resupply. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheFinalAssault.ResistCouncil=Complete the research project "The Final Assault" when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheFinalAssault.ResistCouncil=After studying the data available to us, we have decided that the best plan is a simple one. Our naval forces will engage Hydra spacecraft around their base and secure a clear flightpath for our assault transport, which will land and unload the {winnerOrg}. Then, our commandos will fight their way to the wormhole entrance and secure it while the payload operators move the bomb into position and detonate it.<br/><br/>The plan has numerous potential points of failure, the largest one being the wormhole itself. We believe that our assault team has enough combat power to fight its way through the Hydra security forces: however, we have no way of knowing how many more may be waiting on the far side. It may be that our assault team will be forced into a battle against an endless stream of reinforcements. Without more data, there is no way to know.<br/><br/>Another potential issue is the payload. The Exotics-based explosives used by the two payloads are experimental, but we believe they should deliver a sufficient quantity of energy to collapse the wormhole. However, we have absolutely no idea what the consequences of "collapsing the wormhole" will be, nor how the explosion may interact with the Exotics-powered wormhole apparatus. Even if we succeed, this may well be a suicide mission for our councilor and everyone else we send in on that transport. A few of our physicists have also theorized that there is a possibility that the wormhole collapse may cause a runaway total-conversion reaction, in which case this will be a suicide mission for our entire fleet.<br/><br/>We are ready to proceed on your order.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheFinalAssault.ResistCouncil=We're ready for launch, Commander.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResistVictory.ResistCouncil=Close the Gate
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResistVictory.ResistCouncil=It is time. Close the wormhole. End this war.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResistVictory.ResistCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target the alien wormhole module at their primary Kuiper Belt base with the {winnerOrgMission} mission.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResistVictory.ResistCouncil=It is done.<br/><br/>Our operation went to plan ... at first. After a brief but fierce engagement, our fleet secured the space around the alien base and escorted the assault transport to its landing zone. Our assault company fought their way through the alien corridors and seized control of the wormhole chamber, allowing our councilor and our explosives engineers to begin setting up the payload. Two waves of alien reinforcements attacked through the wormhole; they were repulsed with only light casualties, and the payload was deployed through the wormhole entrance.<br/><br/>At which point something went wrong. Our payload was designed to be transported via two self-propelled drones, linked via a reinforced cable. The far-side drone was sent through the wormhole and reported successful transit, then abruptly ceased transmitting. At this point a third wave of alien reinforcements, larger in number and using heavy combat equipment, attacked through the gateway, inflicting serious casualties. With our numbers dwindling, the fight still raging, and the far-side drone still offline, our councilor elected to lead six volunteers through the wormhole, with the aim of reactivating and detonating the payload.<br/><br/>We don't know what happened on the far side. All we know is that shortly after their transit, we received a message via drone link instructing our forces to withdraw. We pulled our surviving forces back and the payload detonated less than a minute later.<br/><br/>The explosion was comparable to that of a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon. This is odd, since according to our calculations, the blast from the Exotics payload should have been at least an order of magnitude greater. We suspect that whatever our councilor did on the other end of the wormhole caused the majority of the energy from the explosion to be discharged on the far side. If the aliens situated the far side of their wormhole in a hab ... well, I doubt there's much left of the hab.<br/><br/>In any case, the operation was a success. We have scanned the remains of the alien base and there are no traces remaining of the Ellis Drainhole, the quantum scaffolding, or any of the alien wormhole apparatus. Our councilor and the six volunteers have been marked as killed in action. Their names will be added to the memorial, along with the thousands more killed in the naval battle.<br/><br/>Still ... we did it. We won. The aliens are far from defeated – hundreds of Hydras remain in our Solar System, along with countless slaves and human servants. We still have to deal with Hydra agents on Earth, as well as their thralls and sympathizers. But the aliens have now lost their greatest advantage. They will have no more reinforcements, no more shipments of Exotics. From now on, their numbers will only diminish, while ours will grow. It will take years, perhaps decades, to defeat the last remnants of the Hydra invasion force, but their cause is now a hopeless one. Today, we have struck the blow that will guarantee humanity's future as an independent species. We are the masters of our Solar System once more.<br/><br/>At least for now.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResistVictory.ResistCouncil=We've done it, Commander. The invaders are cut off from their home and their forces are in disarray around the Solar System. Humanity is free to chart its own course once again.

TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.DestroyCouncil=Perform Surveil Location missions in areas with a suspected alien presence. Send councilors on Investigate Alien Activity missions when you discover evidence of alien influence on the populace or leaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.DestroyCouncil=It's just as bad as we feared.<br/><br/>Our councilors have independently confirmed that the returned abduction victims are now spying on local government, military, and police affairs. None of the returned abductees had any previous interest in or history of espionage. Now all of a sudden they're conducting surveillance, leaving dead drops, and cooperating with other abductees.<br/><br/>We've managed to intercept and detain several abductees in the middle of these missions. Even when caught red-handed, they deny all involvement with the kind of intensity you'd expect from a hardened operative. Something has changed these teenagers, office workers, and farmhands into spies, terrorists, and agitators. But what?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateEnthrallMission.DestroyCouncil=There's no doubt, Colonel. The monsters are at our gates.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOperations.DestroyCouncil=Research Their Operations
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOperations.DestroyCouncil=The aliens are infiltrating our society, using their abduction victims as pawns. We need to investigate their patterns of behavior to learn what they're attempting to accomplish.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOperations.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Alien Operations" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.DestroyCouncil=It is now clear that what we are facing is nothing less than all-out invasion. The aliens have some way of subverting their captives that leaves them under alien control.<br/><br/>Countries in which the aliens have been active are seeing rapid upswings in pro-alien and collaborationist views. People of influence – politicians, celebrities, media personalities – are suddenly changing their views and agitating strongly for pro-alien policies. The process is frighteningly fast. People who oppose the new policies may be fired, imprisoned, or killed, or they may also have a sudden "conversion." It's like watching the spread of a cult, except a thousand times faster.<br/><br/>We need to stop this, but how? Eliminating the humans who have been brought under alien control is impractical – the contagion spreads far too quickly and widely. What we really need is some way to identify exactly who has been compromised, but it's hard to see how we can do that without being able to track alien activity.<br/><br/><h>We have activated an alien threat monitor that estimates the likelihood they are going to target our intrests directly. It is visible in the top-right of the main game view.</h></h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOperations.DestroyCouncil=Colonel, the enemy is infiltrating our society, turning our people against us. We can trust no one.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMovements.DestroyCouncil=Research Alien Movements
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMovements.DestroyCouncil=To have any chance of stopping the alien invasion, we need some way to track their movements. Discover some way to follow and find them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMovements.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Alien Movements" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMovements.DestroyCouncil=It wasn't easy, but we've managed to forge the beginnings of an alliance against the enemy. Over a dozen intelligence agencies and military/paramilitary groups have agreed to cooperate against the aliens, with more joining each week. A lot of these men were ones I would have shot on sight a couple of years back, and now we're allies. Funny old world.<br/><br/>We're already placing observers in (or taking control of) communications companies and surveillance agencies at key points across the globe. The next time an alien shows up, we should be in position to properly welcome it to Earth. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMovements.DestroyCouncil=If we can track them, we can kill them, Colonel. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOrigin.DestroyCouncil=Research Alien Origin
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOrigin.DestroyCouncil=Some of the eggheads are saying that the bits of wreckage we picked up prove that the UFO was built in our Solar System. If they're right, that means the aliens must have a base here. Maybe we could find it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOrigin.DestroyCouncil=Research the Skywatch and Deep System Skywatch global technologies, and then the Alien Origin project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOrigin.DestroyCouncil=I thought those Skywatch projects were a waste of time when we had aliens right here on our doorstep, but I have to admit, they've paid off. We've found the alien base in the Kuiper Belt. The question is, where did it come from?<br/><br/>The eggheads say that the ship that crashed was built within two years prior to its arrival, probably in one of those alien habs. There are all sorts of theories being tossed around as to where they came from, but the important part is that they're here and it looks like they've got no intention of leaving. If we're going to convince them otherwise, getting rid of every alien ship and hab we can see would be a good start.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOrigin.DestroyCouncil=We've located what must be the invaders' forward operating base, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.AccessHydraCorpus.DestroyCouncil=Kill an alien
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.AccessHydraCorpus.DestroyCouncil=Now that we can finally track the aliens here on Earth, we can find out some more about them. Best way to do that is to cut up a dead one. Try to keep it mostly intact.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.AccessHydraCorpus.DestroyCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct an Assassinate mission against it. It is possible assaulting alien installations on Earth or in space may also yield an alien body for study, but it is difficult to predict under what circumstances that might occur.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.AccessHydraCorpus.DestroyCouncil=Well, that was satisfying.<br/><br/>The alien walked into the ambush right on schedule and went down to rifle fire. It tried to get up, so the boys broke out the heavy weapons. Long story short, it's definitely dead. Our chief pathologist has complained about the number of bullets he's going to have to pick out. We told him to stop whining.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.AccessHydraCorpus.DestroyCouncil=They can bleed, Colonel. And they can die.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchHydraBiology.DestroyCouncil=Research Hydra Biology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchHydraBiology.DestroyCouncil=We've finally got a dead alien. Let's cut it up and see what we can learn.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchHydraBiology.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Hydra Biology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchHydraBiology.DestroyCouncil=Our chief pathologist has sent in his report. It's fifteen pages long so I'll give you the short version.<br/><br/>Our alien visitors are big and tough – a bit over two meters tall. They breathe oxygen, they eat carbon-based food, they talk in clicks, and they're really damn ugly. From a tactical point of view, three things stand out.<br/><br/>First: these things are REALLY goddamn hard to kill. They have a redundant biology with three heart/brain clusters – shoot one out and the thing can just switch to its backups and keep on fighting. You have to take out at least two clusters if you want to put it down for good. Info sheets with cluster locations are being distributed to all our frontline troops, but until we figure out something more precise, we're recommending use of heavy weapons.<br/><br/>Second: these things breed slow. They start as hermaphrodites and only become male or female towards the end of their lifespan (which is long – two centuries). It sounds as though they reproduce a lot slower than we do, which suggests they'll have trouble replacing losses. Might be some way to take advantage of that.<br/><br/>Third and most important, we might have a clue as to how their damn mind control works. The giant ugly thing on their face is some kind of sensory organ like a nose that takes in particles, but it also expels them – they have internal organs that produce tiny particles that the face organ vents into the air. The biologists are calling these particles "pherocytes" – the theory is that they might be able to use them to talk or control behavior the way ants do. They don't know how that can make a human drop whatever he's doing and obey a giant alien, but they want to find out. I'd recommend we let them.<br/><br/>Finally, given that the aliens are giant demonic monsters that regenerate, our people have started calling them "hydras." It's as good a name as any.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchHydraBiology.DestroyCouncil=The autopsy of the dead alien is complete, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocytes.DestroyCouncil=Research Hydra Pherocytes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocytes.DestroyCouncil=The Hydras seem to use pherocytes – information-heavy biological emanations – as a communication tool. Maybe this is the key to their mind control? For now, at least, it's the best lead we've got.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocytes.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Hydra Pherocytes" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocytes.DestroyCouncil=Well, for good or bad, we've got our answer. Our biologists are 99 percent certain that these "pherocytes" are how the Hydras are able to control their victims. The particles enter the system via the respiratory system or mucous membranes and make their way to the brain. Once there, they effectively grant the Hydras complete mental control over the target. There doesn't seem to be any limit to it – even suicidally dangerous orders will be carried out without hesitation. All a Hydra needs is time, and it can press-gang an army of fanatically loyal slaves. It's what every crazy warlord and tin-pot dictator in Earth history has dreamed of – soldiers that can't disobey. And the Hydras can make them just by breathing.<br/><br/>The good news is that the pherocytes can be stopped – standard MOPP gear provides complete protection, and even a basic gas mask will work in a pinch. The bad news is that once the pherocytes are in your system, we've got no way to get them out. They lose effectiveness over time, but given that the Hydras will be constantly topping up the pherocyte levels on their slaves, that doesn't help much.<br/><br/>Our research teams say they've learned all they can from the body. If we want to find out more, we'll need a live subject.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocytes.DestroyCouncil=Take a look at this, Colonel. We're beginning to understand how they control their foot soldiers.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienContainment.DestroyCouncil=Research Hydra Containment
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienContainment.DestroyCouncil=We need a captive Hydra, which means we need a prison for it. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienContainment.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Hydra Containment" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienContainment.DestroyCouncil=We've set up a facility that our eggheads claim will hold a Hydra safely contained. Filtration systems block pherocytes, and reinforced bars should be impervious to any attempt at a breakout. We've also installed antipersonnel mines within the cell and I'm keeping hold of the detonator. Just in case.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienContainment.DestroyCouncil=We're ready to cage the demon, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.CaptureAHydra.DestroyCouncil=Capture a Live Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.CaptureAHydra.DestroyCouncil=Bring in a Hydra for questioning. Alive.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.CaptureAHydra.DestroyCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct a Detain mission against it. It may also be possible to locate an Alien Facility in an Earth region and conduct an Assault Alien Asset mission against it or detect and capture an alien hab out in the Solar System.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.CaptureAHydra.DestroyCouncil=I had to supervise this one personally – a lot of the boys did not like the idea of keeping this thing in one piece. Two of them tried to bring machine guns "just in case." It was just as well we'd had those anatomy briefings – the info was good, but the thing still got within five meters before we finally brought it down.<br/><br/>I was worried we'd done too much damage, but the thing's already regenerating. First time I've been glad these things are so hard to kill. The chief xenologist says that it should be conscious within twenty-four hours. Now we need to figure out how to interrogate it once it wakes up.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.CaptureAHydra.DestroyCouncil=Mission accomplished, Colonel. We're face to face with the enemy.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.DestroyCouncil=Communicate with captured Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.DestroyCouncil=How do you interrogate something that talks half in clicks and half by smell? Well, that's what the language teams are trying to figure out. We'll be giving them working access to the Hydra ... under close supervision. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.DestroyCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.DestroyCouncil=Well, that was a headache. We've had multiple teams working around the clock trying a dozen different methods. In the end it was the Swiss team from ETH Zurich who came up with a solution – a jury-rigged automated analyzer modified to measure pherocyte levels from second to second. Combined with audio analysis, they're pretty confident they can understand what it's saying. Talking back is going to be harder, but we're building up a database of Hydra click vocabulary that should be enough for basic conversation. It's not going to be pretty, but it won't be the first time I've had to do an interrogation where I don't speak the language. At least it's in a proper facility this time instead of a safehouse with a table and chair.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.DestroyCouncil=We're cracking their code, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=Salvage Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=Every resistance movement has to start somewhere. The lucky ones get to bring their own weapons. The unlucky ones have to cheat. We're going to cheat, and that means taking on the aliens and getting working samples of their tech. It won't be easy, but there's no other way.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=Successfully engage one of the following alien assets: facility, landed UFO, orbital habitat, warship, or army, then research the Alien Technology project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=Well, we did it. We took on the aliens on the field of battle and won. And we've earned the spoils – working examples of alien technology. If things weren't so dire, we'd be celebrating. Actually, the science teams are celebrating anyway. Never seen these guys so excited. I feel like slapping them down and reminding them just how many lives those shiny toys cost us, but I suppose there's no point.<br/><br/>The stuff we've got in the labs now is beyond anything that's ever been produced on Earth. Any R&D company would kill for just a sniff. If we were in the business of making money, we'd be set for life. But we're not – we're fighting for humanity and for Earth, and this stuff only matters if it can help with that. There's a long road ahead, but we're one step further along it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=We've defeated the aliens in the field. Now to gather the spoils.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=Research Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=We've taken the first steps towards understanding the alien technology, but there's a long way to go. If we can figure out how their tech works, maybe it'll give us some clues about how to beat them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Alien Technology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=We've finally managed to get a handle on the principles the alien tech is built on, and for once, we've got some good news. We've definitely confirmed that every piece of alien technology we've looked at has been built right here in our solar system, using mostly materials from the planets and asteroids around our Sun. The fact that the aliens are using weapons and ships that they built here, and not just bringing a fleet of battleships straight from their home, suggests they're operating under some harsh resource constraints. If we can destroy their Solar System manufacturing facilities, they'll be crippled.<br/><br/>There is, however, a catch. Almost every single piece of alien tech contains some kind of alloy that our scientists can't identify at all. The materials boys claim that it's this alien alloy that allows their ships to do what they do. Unfortunately, even if we melted down every piece of alien tech we've got, we still wouldn't have enough of the stuff for a proper study. We're going to need something bigger.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienTechnology.DestroyCouncil=We're learning and adapting, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienWarship.DestroyCouncil=Salvage Alien Warship
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienWarship.DestroyCouncil=To understand the alien tech, we need a large-scale supply of alien alloys, and the only way to get them in that kind of volume is from an alien warship. They outclass our space vessels in every way, and we're going to have to beat one. I don't like to think of how many men we're going to lose doing this. Wish there was some other way.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienWarship.DestroyCouncil=Engage and defeat an alien warship, then research the "Alien Warships" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienWarship.DestroyCouncil=We paid a heavy price, but I think it was worth it.<br/><br/>The alien warship makes old Earth spacecraft look like children's toys. Weapons systems, propulsion, armor – they're all superior to our most advanced craft in every way. Once we boarded it, though, resistance was light, and our marines swept the thing in no time at all. It looks as though their ships run with practically a skeleton crew. Everything that can be automated is automated. Good news is that this reinforces our early suspicions about the alien birth rate – they don't have many bodies to spare. Bad news is that it doesn't take them many bodies to man those ships. We are going to have to kill damn near every last one of them.<br/><br/>Anyway, the most important thing is that we've now got alien alloys to spare. The stuff is used in every part of the ship's construction, from electronics to superstructure to armor to weapons. We're sending the stuff to our research departments in preparation for our next project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienWarship.DestroyCouncil=We're turning the tide, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExotics.DestroyCouncil=Research Exotics
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExotics.DestroyCouncil=It seems these alien materials are how they can get such crazy performance out of their technology. If we can figure out how it works, maybe we can close the gap. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExotics.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Exotic Materials" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExotics.DestroyCouncil=I've never seen the research teams so excited. It's hard to get them to slow down long enough to understand what the hell they're saying.<br/><br/>Long story short: these Exotics, as the eggheads are now calling them, act as a kind of universal materials enhancer. Exotic-enhanced circuitry conducts electricity better than our most conductive materials and Exotic-enhanced armor has a higher hardness and toughness than our best Earth equivalents. There's not a tool, weapon, or machine on our planet that can't be improved by this stuff. If we could make it ourselves, we could catch up to the aliens and then some. Unfortunately, we can't. Not a single one of our researchers has even a half-viable plan for synthesizing this stuff – it uses a substance that's not found on Earth treated by some process that we don't understand. They're going to keep working on it, but in the meantime, the only place we're getting this stuff is off the aliens – which means paying a price in blood.<br/><br/>Every one of our science, engineering, and construction teams is begging for as much Exotics as we can give them. We don't have enough to satisfy even a twentieth of the requests. Spend it wisely.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExotics.DestroyCouncil=Colonel, the science section has finished their analysis of the alien materials.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ConductHydraInterrogation.DestroyCouncil=Interrogate captive Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConductHydraInterrogation.DestroyCouncil=We've got a working human-to-Hydra translation system. Time to see what we can learn from our guest. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConductHydraInterrogation.DestroyCouncil=Complete the "Hydra Interrogation" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraInterrogation.DestroyCouncil=Subject was initially uncooperative. Under persuasion, it revealed the following.<br/><br/>1. The Hydras came here to enslave the inhabitants of Earth, and press them into service as "battle thralls," ie slave soldiers. They have already enslaved at least two other species in this way, which we named the "salamanders" and the "griffins."<br/>2. The Hydras arrived in our solar system less than one year before first contact via a discontinuity in space-time, more commonly known as a wormhole. Our end of the wormhole is situated at the main alien base in the Kuiper Belt; the other end is in another solar system controlled by the Hydra.<br/>3. The wormhole requires an enormous amount of energy to create and maintain and can only admit a relatively small quantity of mass over a designated period. This places sharp limits on the quantity of personnel and technology our invaders can bring with them.<br/>4. Due to point 3, the Hydra invasion force is relatively small. The subject estimated that there are no more than 500 Hydras currently present in the Solar System. Their slaves outnumber them many times over, and their entire spacefleet was constructed here.<br/>5. The Hydras appear extremely unified in viewpoint and outlook. The subject, along with all other Hydras in our system, identifies as a member of the "defense consensus." They are fully committed to the enslavement of all other species and there are no dissident Hydra factions. There is of course always the possibility that the subject is lying, but all evidence suggests that peaceful relations are impossible. Ultimately, there are only two likely outcomes: they enslave us, or we kill them.<br/><br/>We will continue the interrogation once the subject regains consciousness.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ConductHydraInterrogation.DestroyCouncil=Colonel, our interrogation has extracted a great deal of information from our captive.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirWeakness.DestroyCouncil=Learn Their Weakness
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirWeakness.DestroyCouncil=Second interrogation session. This time, our focus will be on angles of attack. We need something we can use against them. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirWeakness.DestroyCouncil=Complete the "Their Weakness" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirWeakness.DestroyCouncil=It's hard to conduct an interrogation when you don't know what you're looking for. How do you stop an alien species that can enslave anything it comes into contact with? Several of our scientists have suggested closing the wormhole, and under pressure, the Hydra admitted that this might be possible. But it would just be a temporary solution to a permanent problem. There'd be nothing stopping the Hydras from creating another wormhole and trying all over again, and maybe doing something even worse.<br/><br/>In the end, it was a chance remark that set us onto the path. Under pressure, the Hydra admitted that the second enslaved species, the "griffins," had presented no military threat. However, the Hydras viewed them with special concern due to their propensity for biological warfare. Upon persistent questioning the subject became agitated and implied that even humanity's (relatively limited) use of biological weapons in the past had further reinforced their decision to invade. Once we were done, and before coming here, I had a quiet word with some of our virologists. It's possible that the Hydra reliance on pherocytes might make them specially vulnerable to biological attacks. I think it's worth investigating.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirWeakness.DestroyCouncil=The aliens' best weapon may also be their Achilles' heel, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchWormholes.DestroyCouncil=Research Wormholes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchWormholes.DestroyCouncil=Our interrogation has confirmed it – the Hydra came here through a wormhole. To defeat them, we'll need some idea of how it works.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchWormholes.DestroyCouncil=Complete the "Wormholes" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchWormholes.DestroyCouncil=The Hydra wormhole is, according to our eggheads, something called an "Ellis Drainhole." Up until a month ago they were telling everyone these things couldn't possibly exist, now they're telling us that they do. Whatever. They've given a long techno-babble explanation which is totally useless from a tactical perspective – long story short, they have no idea how it works, they have no idea how the aliens made it, and they have no idea of where to start looking.<br/><br/>The one bit of useful information they've come up with is that the two sides of the wormhole are unequal. Mass limits going back through the wormhole are much lower than mass limits coming here. Apart from that all they can tell us is "more research is required." I hate these guys.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchWormholes.DestroyCouncil=Colonel, we're coming to understand the alien interstellar transport system.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienChokePoint.DestroyCouncil=Research The Choke Point
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienChokePoint.DestroyCouncil=Early research isn't promising, but we've got no choice but to keep trying. Continue researching the enemy wormhole and hope for a lucky break.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienChokePoint.DestroyCouncil=Complete the "The Choke Point" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienChokePoint.DestroyCouncil=Well, sending our ships through the Hydra wormhole is definitely out. Even if we could get past the whole "frontal attack on the Hydra system" problem, the mass limits are far too low. Anything we send back through there has to be extraordinarily deadly in proportion to its mass.<br/><br/>If we want to stop the Hydra from sending an endless stream of reinforcements through an endless stream of wormholes, we're going to have to take that wormhole and send SOMETHING through it that'll finish this for good. The only weapons that have the slightest chance of doing the job are chemical, biological, or nuclear.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienChokePoint.DestroyCouncil=The alien gate is not one-way, Colonel. We can send a weapon through.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchHydraBiowarfare.DestroyCouncil=Research Hydra Biowarfare
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchHydraBiowarfare.DestroyCouncil=Our interrogation has suggested the possibility of using the Hydra pherocytes as a delivery system for a biological weapon. Using various methods of persuasion, we've assembled a collection of virologists with expertise in engineered biological warfare. And yes, they got that expertise from exactly where you'd expect. This project is going to be blacker than black – if it gets out that we've assembled this team, half the governments on Earth are going to turn on us.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchHydraBiowarfare.DestroyCouncil=Research the "Hydra Biowarfare" project when it becomes available
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchHydraBiowarfare.DestroyCouncil=I can't believe I'm saying this, but we've got some good news.<br/><br/>We've finally learned why the Hydras are so frantic about the possibility of biological warfare. Those pherocytes they use to talk to each other go straight into the most vulnerable parts of a Hydra's system without being filtered at all. Which means that if those pherocytes contain something harmful, it gets full access. It's like a human eating poison, except a Hydra can't vomit or spit it out.<br/><br/>Of course there's bad news as well – while pherocytes make it incredibly easy to infect a Hydra with a bioweapon, they don't make them any easier to kill. The virologists tried a dozen different viruses designed to attack Hydra tissue or cell structure. None worked. The Hydra immune system is just too strong – as soon as the virus started to spread, the Hydra leucocytes would adapt and wipe it out.<br/><br/>Okay, so this is the part that isn't going in the AAR. One of our virologists is a guy I'll call Doctor S. You haven't heard of him, but you'd recognize his work. I really didn't want to bring him on board, but the handful of people who knew him admitted that he was the best. And he delivered.<br/><br/>Doctor S. took a different approach to the rest of our team. Instead of trying to beat the Hydra immune system, he came up with a way of compromising it. His virus migrates to the part of the Hydra anatomy they're calling the "bursa," the Hydra equivalent to human bone marrow. Doesn't do any damage, just changes the recipe. The altered bursa produces altered leucocytes, and the altered leucocytes attack the Hydra system. Basically it takes that super-strong immune system the Hydra have, and turns it against them. It starts slow, but once it gets going ... well, let's just say it's effective.<br/><br/>I've seen the tests, and I honestly believe we've got the weapon that can win this war. Now we need a delivery system.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchHydraBiowarfare.DestroyCouncil=We've found the weapon that can win this war, Colonel.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchDestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=Set Our Goals
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchDestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=It's early days, but we need to come up with some kind of action plan. How can we win this war?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchDestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=Complete the "Purify the Earth" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchDestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=There was a lot of disagreement on this one. Do we fight the aliens on Earth, or in space? Do we focus on the aliens, or on collaborators? And how can we get rid of these invaders for good?<br/><br/>Without knowing more, there are no easy answers. But for now, this is our best guess.<br/><br/>1. Investigate the alien abductions. Figure out what the aliens are trying to accomplish by doing this, and figure out a way of sabotaging their plans, whatever they are.<br/>2. Acquire samples of the aliens and of their technology. Analyze them for weaknesses.<br/>3. Exploit those weaknesses to drive the aliens from Earth and make sure they don't come back.<br/><br/>Easy to say, hard to do. The one thing everyone agrees on, though? We want to make damn sure these aliens aren't coming back. Get rid of them. Whatever it takes.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchDestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=The aliens and their human puppets must be destroyed, Colonel, by any means necessary.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchKilltheHive.DestroyCouncil=Prepare to Kill the Hive
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchKilltheHive.DestroyCouncil=We've got our virus. Now we need to figure out a way to spread it to the Hydras.<br/><br/>All of them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchKilltheHive.DestroyCouncil=Complete the "Kill the Hive" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchKilltheHive.DestroyCouncil=Most of our research on the Hydra pherocytes has focused on stopping or on sabotaging them. A couple of teams, though, have been looking more thoroughly into how they work. Standard Hydra pherocyte communications are incredibly complex, with a lot of information we can't decode. However, there are certain "building block" pherocytes that function as basic imperatives, similar to human fight/flight/submit reactions. Tests on captive Hydra have confirmed that in sufficient quantity, these pherocytes have an overwhelming effect on behavior.<br/><br/>We've only been able to identify and reproduce four of these pherocytes so far, but one of them is one our boys have taken to calling the "huddle" pherocyte. It causes Hydra to congregate and share pherocytes as widely as possible. With a sufficiently strong dose, the Hydras they share it with will produce the same pherocyte in turn, causing them to seek out other Hydras, who'll seek out other Hydras ... and so on. Put it together with our anti-immune virus, and we've got the two halves of our whole. A weapon that'll kill every Hydra it comes in contact with, and a distribution system that guarantees it'll spread as widely as possible.<br/><br/>Once our virus was ready, we tested it on our captive. The "huddle" command obviously didn't do much, though the Hydra did itself a fair bit of damage trying to follow the directive. Once the initial pherocyte dose wore off, it calmed down and seemed unaware of the infection. Dr. S estimated an initial incubation period of forty-six hours, and he was right on the money, as usual. I'll admit, though, even I wasn't expecting how fast it progressed afterwards. Must be some sort of tipping point once enough of the leucocytes get compromised. Six hours of increasingly erratic behavior followed by frenzy. We're not sure whether the Hydra actually went insane or whether the infection was just causing enough pain to make it seem that way. The noise and the violence were bad enough that the guards wanted to finish it off. I overruled them on Doctor S's request. Said he needed the data. Took three and a half hours for it to die, and he stayed in the observation booth the whole time. From the way he acted, you'd think he was watching a football game.<br/><br/>After all that, building the delivery system was simple. Basic particulate bomb. The whole thing comes in at under thirty kilos, easily under the mass limit. Now we just need to get it there.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchKilltheHive.DestroyCouncil=The pieces are in place, Colonel. All units are awaiting your orders.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.DestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=Kill them All
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.DestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=Well. This is it.<br/><br/>The delivery package for what our designers have named the Shiva virus is ready. Our forces will engage the aliens at their base and provide cover while our councilor reaches the wormhole, arms the bomb, and send it through.<br/><br/>We're expecting heavy casualties, but all that matters is delivering that weapon. Send it through at any cost.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.DestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target the alien wormhole module at their primary Kuiper Belt base with the {winnerOrgMission} mission.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.DestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=It's done.<br/><br/>Our escort and screening units sacrificed themselves to ensure the assault transport made it through. The wormhole was secured by an ops team, which successfully engaged and held off the enemy ground forces while our councilor armed the package. The aliens responded with heavy reinforcements; our ops team's signals went dark one by one. Our councilor's last transmission before being cut short by enemy fire was that the package had been delivered.<br/><br/>With their objective completed, our surviving naval forces broke contact and withdrew. The Hydras stayed in defensive formation around their wormhole and didn't pursue.<br/><br/>Forty-eight hours passed as though they were days.<br/><br/>Around the fifty-hour mark, we began to notice irregularities. Hydra ships began moving in new and erratic patterns; we detected evidence of at least one collision. Fifty-three hours and forty-nine minutes after the weapon was delivered, the energy signature associated with the enemy wormhole cut off. All data that we can gather suggests that it has been collapsed. The wormhole is gone, and the Hydra invasion is over.<br/><br/>We'll probably never know what happened on the other side. Our men are telling stories, letting their imaginations fill in the gaps; Hydra habs filled with insane, thrashing aliens, attacking each other and themselves as the Shiva virus ate their bodies from the inside out. Maybe they collapsed the wormhole deliberately in a last desperate attempt to protect themselves; maybe the mechanism was destroyed accidentally as dying Hydra fought each other. What matters is that it's gone.<br/><br/>There's still work to do. Not all the Hydra in our system have been infected; there are outlying habs and ships to destroy, not to mention their slaves on Earth. But they're alone, now. No more reinforcements, no more Exotics. It's just them against us ... and there are a hell of a lot more of us than there are of them.<br/><br/>I'd like to think we got them all, but realistically, we probably didn't. No virus has a one hundred percent kill rate. So there are probably survivors. It's a pity, in a way ... but I'll admit, there's a certain satisfaction to knowing that they'll remember what happened when they tried to invade Earth. At least, they'll remember while they still can. Because we're not done. We know now that interstellar travel is possible ... and we're not going to wait around for them to come back for another try.<br/><br/>Next time, we'll be the ones coming for them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.DestroyVictory.DestroyCouncil=A glorious victory, Colonel. Next time, we'll be the ones coming for them.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.EscapeCouncil=Investigate Alien Crash
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.EscapeCouncil=First contact came when an alien spacecraft aerobraked in our upper atmosphere before crashing down in a remote territory and apparently self-destructing. The remains of that spacecraft could potentially advance human spaceflight capabilities by centuries. We should send a councilor to the site immediately.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.EscapeCouncil=Have a councilor conduct the Investigate Alien Activity mission at the crash site.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.EscapeCouncil=Despite heavy security, we have been able to gather some debris from the crash site. Our scientists are eager to begin research.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.EscapeCouncil=An amazing turn of events, Director. Let us hope they have come in peace.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirSignatures.EscapeCouncil=Research Alien Signatures
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirSignatures.EscapeCouncil=We have managed to acquire a scattering of alien debris that will hopefully enable us to begin the long, slow process of understanding the alien technology. We should begin research immediately.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirSignatures.EscapeCouncil=When it becomes available, complete the "Alien Signatures" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirSignatures.EscapeCouncil=Unfortunately, the samples we acquired were too small and limited to give us any real understanding of the alien spacecraft, though it has left us with tantalizing clues. In other news, an alien survived the crash and has moved into nearby wilderness territory. Oddly, we are receiving reports of disappearances in nearby communities. As yet, we have no explanation as to why.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirSignatures.EscapeCouncil=We did not learn much, Director, but we have many prospects for future discovery.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienAbductions.EscapeCouncil=Investigate Alien Abductions
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienAbductions.EscapeCouncil=The majority of our research team believe the recent claims of alien abductions are simply a product of local superstition and media hysteria, but the frequency of the reports is becoming disturbing. Perhaps we should investigate.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.EscapeCouncil=Conduct Surveil Location missions in regions near any alien crash sites. If abductions are detected, send a councilor on an Investigate Alien Activity mission at that location.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.EscapeCouncil=Although we cannot rule out the possibility of a hoax, a statistically significant quantity of animals and humans have been reported missing in the area surrounding the alien spacecraft's crash-landing. Although our researchers are far more interested in the possibilities of the alien technology, it's probably worth taking a closer look.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienAbductions.EscapeCouncil=Something strange and unfortunate appears to be underway, Director, but we must keep pursuing more information.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMethods.EscapeCouncil=Research Alien Methods
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMethods.EscapeCouncil=We have gathered a huge amount of data and reports concerning these so-called "alien abductions." Winnowing accurate information from the chaff of exaggerated and sensationalist stories will take time.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMethods.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Alien Methods" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMethods.EscapeCouncil=The earliest disappearances were all of lower-order mammals, unremarkable except in their frequency and number. Over a period of 10-20 days after the crash-landing, these animal disappearances ceased and human disappearances began. Early human disappearances followed no obvious pattern, but later ones have included a disproportionate fraction of individuals with high socio-economic status.<br/><br/>The mood among the research team is bleak. It seems our hopes of co-existence and information exchange are to be dashed. The aliens appear to be at the very least unconcerned with our welfare, and may well be actively hostile.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMethods.EscapeCouncil=Director, our hopes of peaceful first contact with our visitor dwindle with every report.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateEnthrallMission.EscapeCouncil=Investigate Returned Abductees
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateEnthrallMission.EscapeCouncil=A number of the "abductees" have returned. Some of our researches have expressed their hope that this indicates that the "abductions" were a hoax – however, given the situation, we do not feel we can afford to be so optimistic. Have our councilors investigate more closely. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.EscapeCouncil=Perform Surveil Location missions in areas with a suspected alien presence. Send councilors on Investigate Alien Activity missions when you discover evidence of alien influence on the populace or leaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.EscapeCouncil=The "hoax" theory has now been abandoned by all but a handful of stubborn holdouts. Our investigators have confirmed that several of the returned abductees are engaging in espionage activities against local governments – in other words, spying. Unfortunately, the most likely explanation is that the aliens are somehow exercising influence over the abductees and using them to gather information. It seems we must re-task some of our research and intelligence capabilities towards investigating the aliens' plans.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateEnthrallMission.EscapeCouncil=Director, it seems we must learn about the aliens and their technologies via means other than diplomacy.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOperations.EscapeCouncil=Research Alien Operations
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOperations.EscapeCouncil=It seems we can no longer avoid making a focused effort towards analyzing the aliens' goals. Based upon what we have discovered about the alien abductions, we should be able to learn more about their operations. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOperations.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Alien Operations" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.EscapeCouncil=Our research has demonstrated strong evidence of aberrant behavior in those countries that have been targeted by alien abductions. Public attitudes are rapidly shifting in a pro-alien direction, driven by key figures in the media, political, and scientific establishments. People close to these figures have independently and consistently commented on their sudden shifts in personality, growing more aloof and seemingly disinterested in all matters not related to human-alien relations.<br/><br/>The alien ability to influence their targets appears far stronger than we had initially believed. Their method of influence is so far unknown. Various wild theories have been concocted, including implanted parasites, technological mind control, biological mind control, highly advanced drugs, or outright replacement by clones, replicants, or infiltrators. We must investigate further to narrow down the possibilities.<br/><br/><h>We have activated an alien threat monitor that estimates the likelihood they are going to target our intrests directly. It is visible in the top-right of the main game view.</h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOperations.EscapeCouncil=They have come from the stars to exert control over human behavior, Director. Humanity is in crisis.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMovements.EscapeCouncil=Research Alien Movements
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMovements.EscapeCouncil=It has been suggested that we divert resources away from tracking the UFOs and towards tracking alien movements on Earth. Our recent discoveries regarding alien influence have given this task a higher priority.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMovements.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Alien Movements" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMovements.EscapeCouncil=Research has discovered that our alien visitors appear to exude biological emissions similar, though distinct from, Earth pheromones. These trails linger and can be detected for days after the alien has left the scene, and are, naturally, entirely unlike anything found on Earth. We have started to mass-produce simple detection units capable of picking up these emissions and distributing them to companies and governments sympathetic to our cause. Combined with predictive analysis, we should now have some capacity to track alien movements on our planet.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMovements.EscapeCouncil=The aliens are no longer hidden from our eyes on Earth, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOrigin.EscapeCouncil=Research Alien Origin
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOrigin.EscapeCouncil=Our analysis of the alien debris, though limited, has produced fascinating results. While a minority of the debris is unidentifiable and may well have come from an extrasolar source, the majority of the material is comprised of elements that appear to have been extracted from distant bodies within our own solar system. Evidence suggests that this ship was assembled within Sol's orbit. We should make it a priority to investigate further.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOrigin.EscapeCouncil=Research the Skywatch and Deep System Skywatch global technologies, and then the Alien Origin project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOrigin.EscapeCouncil=Analysis of the alien habitats discovered through our Skywatch programs has provided a clearer picture of alien activities. It appears that the aliens have not been active in our Solar System for long – 2021 at earliest. Their ability to build this ship so quickly demonstrates remarkably advanced engineering, but the bigger question is obvious: if they have been here so recently, where did they come from?<br/><br/>Many theories have been proposed, but two possibilities have attracted the most attention. First, that the aliens travelled here from another solar system via advanced but conventional propulsion methods. Second, that the aliens traveled here from another solar system using some unknown method of faster-than-light travel.<br/><br/>Both possibilities are tremendously exciting. The first possibility implies that the aliens have discovered some way to overcome all of the hurdles that have thus far prevented us from developing any kind of slower-than-light interstellar travel. The second possibility implies that our entire understanding of physics is wildly wrong. In either case, the aliens have the technology to travel between, and settle, the stars.<br/><br/>If we could acquire this technology for ourselves ...
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOrigin.EscapeCouncil=We must learn how they arrived in our Solar System, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.AccessHydraCorpus.EscapeCouncil=Acquire an Alien Corpus
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.AccessHydraCorpus.EscapeCouncil=Our attempts to learn from the aliens from a distance have, unfortunately, reached their limit. To further advance our understanding of the aliens and the methods by which they can influence human populations so effectively, our research teams have requested direct examination of an alien specimen. While regrettable, ethical concerns about a member of a species bent on infiltrating our society must in this instance be ranked below the cause of scientific progress.<br/><br/>Addendum from research team: Given the level of influence the aliens appear capable of exerting upon humans, we feel that for this first step a deceased alien might be preferable to a live one.<br/><br/>It is important, however, that we carefully consider the timing of the operation, and alert all of our stations to be ready for reprisals from the aliens and their human allies.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.AccessHydraCorpus.EscapeCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct an Assassinate mission against it. It is possible assaulting alien installations on Earth or in space may also yield an alien body for study, but it is difficult to predict under what circumstances that might occur.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.AccessHydraCorpus.EscapeCouncil=The mission was a success! Though some casualties were sustained, fortunately no essential personnel were harmed. Our scientists are absolutely fascinated at the prospect of examining a species that has evolved outside of Earth – not only that, but a sapient, and in all likelihood more advanced one! This has the potential to absolutely revolutionize our understanding of biology, just as the alien technology will revolutionize our understanding of physics.<br/><br/>A lively competition is underway as to which of our teams should be allowed to name the new species. Various taxonomies have been proposed, though in the meantime, our less educated personnel have apparently begun to refer to the alien species as "hydras," after the mythical creature. In any case, we should begin our autopsy immediately.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.AccessHydraCorpus.EscapeCouncil=Our biologists are ready to begin their autopsy on what the strike team brought home, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchHydraBiology.EscapeCouncil=Research Hydra Biology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchHydraBiology.EscapeCouncil=Our newly-renamed Xenobiology division is standing by to conduct the autopsy. Every biologist in our group wants to be present for the procedure. We may need a bigger lab.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchHydraBiology.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Hydra Biology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchHydraBiology.EscapeCouncil=The alien corpus has provided us with a treasure trove of information. It is carbon-based, oxygen-breathing, and stands approximately 220cm tall, with knees located in the upper halves of its legs in a pattern similar to an Earth canid. Cooling is provided by a sublimating sweat mechanism.<br/><br/>Internally, a striking feature is that the nervous and circulatory systems are combined. There are three heart/nerve clusters: one in the head, proximal to the topmost vertebrae, and two in the abdomen, at the right hypochondrium and the left iliac region. This redundant system means that barring catastrophic damage to multiple heart/nerve clusters, an alien can regenerate most if not all functionality. Though the loss of one cluster is likely to impede higher cognitive function, an alien with two working clusters should still be capable of basic to intermediate tasks.<br/><br/>The alien regenerative capability appears to prevent any kind of senescence: individuals are theorized to be able to maintain consistent fitness, mobility, and cognition for the majority of their natural lives, estimated as being between 160 to 200 years. This does come at a cost: their physiology is highly complex, necessitating a slow gestational and development cycle and a low birth rate.<br/><br/>Individual aliens are nongendered at birth. Each member of the species is born with latent male and female reproductive organs; at a certain point in their life cycle, specific conditions precipitate the development of one set of organs. Though not uncommon on Earth, sequential hermaphroditism on our planet is only found in lower-order creatures such as fish, gastropods, and plants. In the case of the aliens, they appear to only become sexual towards the end of their life cycle, and once sex assignment is complete there is no changing back.<br/><br/>While the clicking noises we recorded during the acquisition of this specimen are complex enough to be a language, we do not believe auditory communication to be their primary mode of exchanging information. Instead, we have found the multi-tipped protuberance on their face and bulbs on the back of their neck to contain elaborate sensory organs that collect data from the air, and pass along that data to a hyper-developed vomeronasal organ, similar to how snakes use their tongues. Unlike snakes, these organs also have the capability to rapidly construct and emit streams of chemical information. We found a reservoir of adaptive cells and various elements and compounds in these organs, which our linguists have theorized may effectively function as an alphabet. This implies a fascinating, bidirectional mechanism, something like pheromones, but via a living cell. Our researchers have dubbed these cells "pherocytes."<br/><br/>Note from Xenobiology division: Preliminary study has suggested that some of these pherocytes may have been specifically tailored to affect humans. We strongly recommend immediate and focused research. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchHydraBiology.EscapeCouncil=Our autopsy report is ready, Director. The details are fascinating.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocytes.EscapeCouncil=Research Hydra Pherocytes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocytes.EscapeCouncil=Our autopsy suggests that the alien pherocytes are central to their communication and – possibly – their influence over their human subjects. Researching them should be a priority.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocytes.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Hydra Pherocytes" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocytes.EscapeCouncil=The alien pherocytes are a fascinating evolutionary phenomenon, totally unlike anything that has developed upon Earth. They are cells that not only contain a vast amount of chemical information, but also function as adaptive factories capable of producing advanced biological compounds. When introduced into the system of a non-Hydra, they make their way to the supra-marginal gyrus within the parietal lobe, then take up residence in the myelin sheath, where they regulate impulse conductivity. From there, they exercise a strong and immediate influence over the subject's empathy, attachments, and drives. This influence persists until the pherocytes die off, which can take days if not weeks. While this is not "mind control" as popular fiction would understand it, the effect is similar.<br/><br/>Although this breakthrough is of course good news, it is nevertheless worrying. The alien ability to exercise control is far more advanced than we had suspected. Preventing pherocyte exposure is relatively straightforward – basic filtration systems will suffice – but without extensive research, we will have no means of countering the pherocytes except time. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocytes.EscapeCouncil=We can only wonder at what environmental circumstances led to this evolutionary adaptation, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienContainment.EscapeCouncil=Research Hydra Containment
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienContainment.EscapeCouncil=Now that we properly understand the methods by which the aliens control their human subjects, we should be able to build a basic containment facility to house a live alien, should such an opportunity arise. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienContainment.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Hydra Containment" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienContainment.EscapeCouncil=The construction of the facility required some testing but was relatively straightforward. Our personnel are confident that it should hold a live alien. On that subject, our research teams have been mentioning that their work would be greatly assisted if they had a live alien to study.<br/><br/>Addendum: despite attempts to encourage the use of a more scientific name, our personnel are continuing to refer to the aliens as "hydras." At this point we may have to give up the battle and accept the term.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienContainment.EscapeCouncil=We are ready to capture an alien, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.CaptureAHydra.EscapeCouncil=Capture a Live Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.CaptureAHydra.EscapeCouncil=Our research into Hydra biology has come to a dead end; to learn more, we require a live specimen. Our science teams have full confidence in your ability to carry out this task.<br/><br/>On a related note, several of our personnel have noted that if we are going to launch a colony ship, it might be prudent to launch it away from Hydra space, rather than towards them, in which case interrogating a Hydra seems to be a logical step.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.CaptureAHydra.EscapeCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct a Detain mission against it. It may also be possible to locate an Alien Facility in an Earth region and conduct an Assault Alien Asset mission against it or detect and capture an alien hab out in the Solar System.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.CaptureAHydra.EscapeCouncil=The operation was a success! Our Xenobiology division insisted on the use of nonlethal weapons against the Hydra target, which led to a certain number of casualties among the operations team when the recommended dosage of sedative turned out to be ineffective. In the end several of our security personnel made unauthorized use of firearms to disable the Hydra; while they have been reprimanded, the Hydra fortunately was able to recover from its injuries and is now safely contained.<br/><br/>Our biologists are busy studying the Hydra's regenerative process and monitoring its health; in the meantime, our linguistics team is eager to begin work on learning its language.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.CaptureAHydra.EscapeCouncil=An alien is in custody, Director. We are ready to attempt to question it.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.EscapeCouncil=Communicate with captured Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.EscapeCouncil=While we have good reason to expect our Hydra to be less than fully cooperative, the possibility of communication with another sentient species carries tremendous potential. Our linguistics team has requested priority access to the captive Hydra. Our biology team, unsurprisingly, has requested the same. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.EscapeCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.EscapeCouncil=Our linguistics team have been working around the clock to compile the first ever English-Hydra translation tool. By analyzing every recorded instance of alien audio that we have, and comparing it to the Hydra's behavior and pherocyte production, they believe they have managed to translate the Hydra clicking sounds into comprehensible sentences. Audio playback should allow us to "talk" to the Hydra in return.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it appears that a great deal of Hydra communication is carried out by pherocytes; the audible component of their language is only a skeleton, which the pherocytes build upon to transmit context and meaning. Since we cannot reproduce Hydra pherocytes ourselves, and exposing our team to the Hydra pherocytes is probably inadvisable, we will be restricted to audio exchanges only. This will make any communication crude and limited. Still, it represents a significant milestone.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.EscapeCouncil=We have made progress in communicating with the alien, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Salvage Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Whatever path we choose, we will need a better understanding of the alien's technology. Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the aliens will willingly hand over a working sample. It appears our only option is to take one by force.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Successfully engage one of the following alien assets: facility, landed UFO, orbital habitat, warship, or army, then research the Alien Technology project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Success! Even damaged and incomplete, the pieces of alien tech we have managed to recover from the battlefield have proven a treasure trove, opening up dozens of avenues of research. Naturally, their spaceflight technology is our primary goal, but the insights we are gaining into alien chemistry and materials science are equally exciting. Our research teams are going to be busy for years. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=This is the break we've been waiting for, Director. Our teams are ready to unlock its secrets.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Research Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Research on the alien technology continues. Our science and engineering teams continue to hope that we may soon be able to reverse-engineer some of the alien designs.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Alien Technology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=Our attempts to understand the alien technology have unfortunately run up against a wall. Though advanced, the majority of the alien designs are not fundamentally dissimilar to our own, and as mentioned, the bulk of their mass is comprised of standard elements mined and processed here in our Solar System. However, every single piece of alien technology of any importance has been found to contain substances that are clearly extrasolar in origin. Our teams are certain that it is these substances that allows the alien designs to outperform ours so comprehensively. To match the alien performance, we must understand how to effectively use them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, to properly study these exotic materials, we need more of them ... much more. The salvage and samples we have acquired so far do not contain anywhere near enough for the tests we have in mind. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienTechnology.EscapeCouncil=We are making progress, Director, but we need additional samples of advanced alien artifacts to go forward.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienWarship.EscapeCouncil=Salvage Alien Warship
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienWarship.EscapeCouncil=Our research teams believe that the next steps in our quest to understand the alien technology will require examination of an actual alien warship. Obviously, given the superiority of their space capabilities, engaging one of them in combat is a less than ideal prospect. However, given your exemplary record thus far, we have the fullest confidence that you will succeed.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienWarship.EscapeCouncil=Engage and defeat an alien warship, then research the "Alien Warships" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienWarship.EscapeCouncil=Our earlier exposure to alien technology at the crash site could not have prepared for the sight of a true alien warship. Though the warship is similar in design and composition, its scale in comparison to even the largest infiltration vessels is humbling.<br/><br/>The ship appears to be highly automated – the vessel is manned only by a skeleton crew apparently consisting almost entirely of engineers. Their job is to ensure that the ship's systems remain online, with only minimal manual control. This helps explain the absence of deceased crew, as they would most likely be vaporized or spaced while working in critical systems during heavy combat.<br/><br/>Despite all we can learn from the alien design, however, by far the most exciting result of this acquisition is that we now, finally, have access to a large quantity of the exotic alien alloys that seem so crucial to their engineering. These alloys are present in significant quantity throughout every system and structure in the warship, from the silver used in the conduit wiring to the massive ablative armor plates. Our teams are eager to begin their analysis.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienWarship.EscapeCouncil=Our forces have scored a victory over an alien spacecraft, Director! The salvage is a treasure trove of alien technology.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExotics.EscapeCouncil=Research Exotics
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExotics.EscapeCouncil=At last, we have access to a sufficient quantity of the extrasolar alloys used in the alien technology. We believe these materials are key to solving the riddle of interstellar travel.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExotics.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Exotic Materials" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExotics.EscapeCouncil=The alien "Exotics," as our scientists are currently calling them, are found in varying amounts throughout every piece of alien technology we have so far recovered. While we still have only the crudest understanding of their structure, their engineering effect, as far as we can discern, is to directly modify the physical properties of whatever substance they are bonded with. The potential applications are quite literally limitless. We can produce circuits with higher conductivity than our best Earth conductors, protective shielding with better impact resistance than our toughest Earth armors, superstructure materials strong enough to withstand stresses beyond anything previously thought possible. Best of all, we can do this without any corresponding trade-offs! Instead of having to choose between properties such as low mass, high strength, and high heat resistance, we can build designs with high marks in all three! So long as we have a sufficient supply of Exotics, virtually anything is possible.<br/><br/>Our hopes have been fulfilled: the alien Exotics are the key to advanced spaceflight and, ultimately, interstellar travel. Unfortunately, there is one great flaw in our plans. Despite all our efforts, producing Exotics remains far beyond our capabilities. For the foreseeable future, we will have only what we can scavenge or steal from the aliens.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExotics.EscapeCouncil=Our mission is clear, Director: We must salvage as much of this Exotic material as possible for Project Exodus to go forward.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ConductHydraInterrogation.EscapeCouncil=Interrogate the captive Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConductHydraInterrogation.EscapeCouncil=With the first ever xeno-translation tool, we are ready to open a dialogue with our "visitor." Our objectives are twofold: discover what we can about the aliens' objectives and plans, and find out what sector of our galaxy they currently occupy.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConductHydraInterrogation.EscapeCouncil=Interrogate the captive Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraInterrogation.EscapeCouncil=The first ever human-to-alien dialogue! It would be a momentous occasion were the situation not so grim.<br/><br/>Our Hydra identifies itself as an engineer/technician and sub-leader, perhaps equivalent to our positions of manager or team supervisor. It claims to be a member of the "Defense Consensus" – perhaps some Hydra corporation or government program? Further interrogation concerning the Hydra species was unfortunately unproductive. The Hydra seems excessively confident that it species will successfully conquer the Earth, and sadly, history appears to be on its side in this regard – they have invaded the homeworlds of two other species and conquered them without difficulty. Frustratingly, the Hydra flatly refuses to provide any information on their faster-than-light technology, except to boast of the superiority it gives them. Several of our more "morally flexible" members have suggested enhanced interrogation techniques, but the majority of our personnel are still uncomfortable with such measures. Besides, there's no guarantee we'd learn anything useful. For now, when it comes to extracting technical information from the Hydra, we are at an impasse.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, we have learned a great deal about the Hydra's astronomical location. Their empire is relatively small, consisting of inhabited worlds around only three stars: Zeta Tucanae, Alpha Mensae, and their homeworld, Delta Pavonis. Given our success in this regard and our lack of progress in others, we have decided to deprioritize further interrogation of the Hydra. Our researchers will have access and will continue to interact with it and refine our translation methods, but our priority will shift to locating a suitable star system for our project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ConductHydraInterrogation.EscapeCouncil=We have learned a great deal from our captive, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExoticHybridSystems.EscapeCouncil=Research Exotic Hybrids
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExoticHybridSystems.EscapeCouncil=While we have a rudimentary understanding of the alien Exotics, we must go further if we ever intend to build a viable interstellar craft. With our stockpile of Exotics, we have identified several lines of research.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExoticHybridSystems.EscapeCouncil=Research the "Exotic Hybrid Systems" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExoticHybridSystems.EscapeCouncil=We are pushing forward the boundaries of human science and engineering. Although producing the alien Exotics is still beyond our capabilities, we are rapidly advancing in our ability to apply them. Rather than using them to alter a single physical property of the targeted material, we are learning to alloy them in specific ways in order to enhance several properties at once.<br/><br/>One of the most promising lines of application is in the field of fusion power. Previous human attempts to build a genuinely effective fusion reactor have been hampered by the astronomical temperatures involved. We now believe that with proper application of Exotics, we should be able to construct a reactor housing with a vastly higher melting point than anything previously thought possible. This would allow us to design a much larger "super-reactor," which would be able to sustain a correspondingly larger and more powerful reaction and thus produce a greatly increased energy output – the other option being our (so far theoretical) research into matter-antimatter energy generation, which would be similarly structurally demanding. According to our astrophysicists and propulsion engineers, both types of reactor could, in theory, supply the quantities of energy necessary for the primary propulsion system of our proposed interstellar mothership.<br/><br/>Interestingly, we have discovered some methods of applying the alien Exotics to ordinary alloys that appear to be slightly but consistently more efficient than the alien designs. Perhaps their access to these fantastic materials has made the aliens complacent.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExoticHybridSystems.EscapeCouncil=The marriage of Earth and Hydra technology shows great promise for our project, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.BeginTheSearch.EscapeCouncil=Begin the Search
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.BeginTheSearch.EscapeCouncil=Every journey starts with a single step. With a better deep space viewing capability, we could search for alien systems ... or untouched ones.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.BeginTheSearch.EscapeCouncil=Research the Deep Space Telescope station module project and build a module at one of your habs.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.BeginTheSearch.EscapeCouncil=Insights gained from our alien research have provided small but crucial improvements to our deep space viewing technology. Our new "Aesir" telescope represents an improvement of at least an order of magnitude upon our best pre-first-contact space viewing arrays. Our astronomers are practically fighting over who gets to use it. Needless to say, they, along with the rest of our personnel, will greatly appreciate it if you could continue to protect the Aesir's hab.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.BeginTheSearch.EscapeCouncil=We are now able to search for humanity's new home, Director.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchANewHome.EscapeCouncil=A New Home
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchANewHome.EscapeCouncil=We now have the tools we need to narrow down a stellar candidate for colonization. Unfortunately, the one star system that we have conclusively established as containing a life-bearing planet with an oxygen-breathable atmosphere – the Hydra homeworld – is the one place we absolutely must avoid. Let's try to find another habitable planet. One with no Hydras on it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchANewHome.EscapeCouncil=Research the "A New Home" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchANewHome.EscapeCouncil=Searching the sky for our new home has been an exhausting process. Our teams of astronomers have worked around the clock, investigating our existing database of known extrasolar planets and using the Aesir to examine their star systems for signs of habitability. It's a little like deciding whether to buy a house when all you know about it is what you can find out by looking through a telescope from another country.<br/><br/>But we have, at last, found our candidate. Two stars within reasonably close proximity of Sol appear to possess planets with a high probability of habitability – Beta Canum Venaticorum (27 light-years distance) and Eta Cassiopeiae A (19 light-years distance). After vigorous debate, we have decided against Eta Cassiopeiae – its low metallicity has prompted concerns about availability of resources for colonization, and its closer location places it significantly closer to the Hydra sphere of influence. Beta Canum Venaticorum is also slightly metal-poor, but less so, and in terms of mass, age, and evolutionary status it is a remarkably close match to our Sun. 27 light-years will not be an easy journey, but that same distance will make it correspondingly more difficult for the Hydras to pursue us.<br/><br/>The planet orbiting Beta Canum Venaticorum is still largely a mystery. Aesir observations have indicated an oxygen atmosphere, likely stemming from a population of cyanobacteria. Beyond that, we know very little. Our colonists will be stepping into the unknown.<br/><br/>Note from our astronomers: Beta Canum Venaticorum is also known as Chara, which in Greek means "Joy." We hope the name will prove well-chosen.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchANewHome.EscapeCouncil=I bring you good news, Director! We have found our destination, and it is far from the alien territory.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchEscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=Set Our Goal
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchEscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=We now know that it is possible – actual, practicable interstellar travel. Other factions on Earth are focused on the aliens and their goals – supporting them, or opposing them. We see them as a means to an end. But what end?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchEscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=Complete the "Leave the Cradle" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchEscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=Debate has raged as to our next move. Some among our group have insisted that it is our responsibility to oppose the alien attempts to gain control over humanity. Others have argued that we should pursue some sort of negotiated solution or peace.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, one faction has prevailed over the others. For the first time in human history, we are on the verge of gaining the ability to leave our Solar System and to become a multi-stellar species. All other considerations pale in comparison to this simple fact.<br/><br/>Perhaps the aliens will succeed in conquering humanity; perhaps the human forces will resist them. But whoever wins, a single planet is an irrelevance on a galactic scale. What matters is whether we as a species will spread beyond Earth and our Solar System. Several individuals have resigned in protest, but our resolve is clear. The aliens possess the ability to colonise other worlds; we must take that ability for ourselves.<br/><br/>There is much work to be done.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchEscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=It is time for humanity to spread to the stars, Director, and you are the one to lead us there.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheGreatJourney.EscapeCouncil=Plot the Great Journey
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheGreatJourney.EscapeCouncil=We have chosen our destination – Beta Canum Venaticorum, otherwise known as Chara. Now we must design our ship and plan our journey.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheGreatJourney.EscapeCouncil=Research "The Great Journey" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheGreatJourney.EscapeCouncil=The blueprints for our first interstellar vessel have been drawn up. Named the "Bifrost," it will be the largest vehicle in human history.<br/><br/>The Bifrost's basic design consists of a large central propulsion and engineering section, with a cylindrical outer ring that will hold our colonists. The ship will spin around its central axis to provide (effective) gravity to the outer ring; the propulsion and engineering section will remain in zero-g. An ablative shield at the ship's rear will be targeted by the hab's launching lasers to provide an initial burst of acceleration to take it out of the Solar System; from there, the main drive will take over, providing a steady acceleration of 0.25g. Speed will peak at 0.97c. Counting both acceleration and deceleration, the total travel time will be 32 years from an Earth frame of reference, but from the perspective of the passengers, 16 years will pass between their departure and their arrival.<br/><br/>The task for our would-be colonists is a daunting one. We have only the most minimal knowledge of our destination. There are hundreds of ways in which the mission can fail, and in this context, mission failure means certain death for every man, woman, and child aboard the ship. Given this, one would expect that we would have very few volunteers. The truth is quite the opposite. The Bifrost will be able to carry 4,180 colonists at maximum capacity, and we already have more than ten times that many applicants, with more approaching us every day. Humanity's pioneer spirit is very much alive.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheGreatJourney.EscapeCouncil=Our mission to Chara is ready, Director. Now we must build the bridge.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ConstructTheBifrost.EscapeCouncil=Construct the Bifrost
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConstructTheBifrost.EscapeCouncil=Only a few steps remain. Our designs have been checked, tested, and simulated in every way we can. Now we face the staggering engineering challenge of building the Bifrost and its launching scaffold.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConstructTheBifrost.EscapeCouncil=Construct the Interstellar Launching Laser Module at one of your habs.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConstructTheBifrost.EscapeCouncil=It's hard to believe we've finally done it. The sheer scale of this project has been mind-boggling – we have drawn resources, expertise, and personnel from every corner of the Earth, not to mention the Solar System. But the Bifrost is completed, and even now it sits in its scaffold at its launching hab. Its size is awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>We have selected our colonists for the Bifrost. With so many applicants, we could afford to be choosy, and our mission requires no less. Our colonists will face a daunting task; first a sixteen-year voyage in cramped conditions, with the Bifrost's systems their only lifeline, followed by the unimaginable challenge of founding a colony from scratch on an alien world. Still, as I look over the roster, I feel confident. The four thousand colonists we have selected represent the best of the human race. On their shoulders rests the task of spreading humanity beyond the Solar System.<br/><br/>All that remains is the launch.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ConstructTheBifrost.EscapeCouncil=We are on the cusp of humanity's greatest achievement, Director. The captain of the Bifrost awaits your orders.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.EscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=Launch
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.EscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=After so much work and so many sacrifices, it is ready. Send a councilor with the final mission briefing to the hab, and launch the Bifrost to humanity's new home. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.EscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target our Interstellar Launch Facility module with the {winnerOrgMission} mission.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.EscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=It is done.<br/><br/>The Bifrost is accelerating away from Earth on its escape vector. Our fleet is continuing to provide protection, but at this point the ship is safe. With the Bifrost's current acceleration and vector, the aliens have nothing that can catch it.<br/><br/>Should an observer write a chronicle of human history, today will be its most important date. Against all odds, humanity has managed to leave our Solar System. I and the rest of the senior management team will in all likelihood not live to see it, but in thirty-two years, the Bifrost will arrive at Chara and begin the process of building a colony. And when it does, humanity will at last become a multi-stellar species. The aliens attempted to conquer us; instead they gave us the key to escaping our cradle.<br/><br/>The war with the aliens rages on. Perhaps we will lose, perhaps we will win. Compared to our achievements today, it's not terribly important. Still, we will continue to resist their attempts to conquer us, if for no reason other than to protect our orbital infrastructure and shipyards. After all, our telescopes have found other habitable planets apart from the one around Chara. And we still have resources, and volunteers, and an alien species apparently quite willing to throw exotic alloys at us in warship form.<br/><br/>If we can build one colony ship, why not more?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.EscapeVictory.EscapeCouncil=Congratulations, Director. You have led humanity to its greatest adventure, an achievement that will be remembered for all of human history.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ExploitCouncil=Investigate Alien Crash
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ExploitCouncil=An unknown spacecraft has crashed in a remote region of our planet. Though not fully confirmed, all evidence we have thus far been able to obtain suggests that this spacecraft is of extraterrestrial origin. We should send a councilor to learn what we can.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ExploitCouncil=Have a councilor conduct the Investigate Alien Activity mission at the crash site.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ExploitCouncil=We have successfully gathered some samples from the crash site and are ready to investigate further. Numerous other groups are attempting to take control of the site in the meantime. Heavy competition seems likely.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.ExploitCouncil=We're out in front of this for now.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirSignatures.ExploitCouncil=Research Alien Signatures
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirSignatures.ExploitCouncil=The small quantity of debris we have gathered from the crash site is ready for analysis. We should also investigate the question of what happened to the ship's crew. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirSignatures.ExploitCouncil=When it becomes available, complete the "Alien Signatures" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirSignatures.ExploitCouncil=Satellite footage and interviews of local personnel have confirmed that at least one of the ship's crew survived the crash and disappeared into the surrounding wilderness. Our research of the debris has also confirmed that the ship was not assembled on Earth. Putting these two things together leads us to one inescapable conclusion: an alien is at large upon our planet, a statement that sounds more appropriate for popular entertainment than for an agenda for the World Economic Council.<br/><br/>Further investigation has turned up reports of disappearances in nearby settlements. This raises troubling questions. What are the aliens doing here, and – given that we have only now detected their presence – how long have they been acting while we have been unaware?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirSignatures.ExploitCouncil=We've analyzed the samples.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ExploitCouncil=Investigate Alien Abductions
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ExploitCouncil=We have been hoping to open some sort of dialogue with our alien visitors, but so far all attempts to locate them have been unsuccessful. At present, our only leads are the reports of disappearances in the area.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ExploitCouncil=Conduct Surveil Location missions in regions near any alien crash sites. If abductions are detected, send a councilor on an Investigate Alien Activity mission at that location.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ExploitCouncil=After a thorough investigation, it seems clear that the aliens are targeting and abducting individual humans; some animals also disappeared early on but this seems to have been quickly halted.<br/><br/>This raises troubling questions. While a handful of human abductions of course pose no large-scale threat, they do suggest that the alien objectives may be fundamentally adversarial to ours. We must investigate further. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienAbductions.ExploitCouncil=We're having trouble envisioning the aliens as any kind of business opportunity.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMethods.ExploitCouncil=Research Alien Methods
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMethods.ExploitCouncil=Given that our attempts to communicate with the aliens have come up against a blank wall, our only viable avenue of investigation appears to be the data we have gathered on the alien abductions. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMethods.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Alien Methods" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMethods.ExploitCouncil=Early abductions were all of lower-order mammals, unremarkable except for their frequency. Over a period of 10-20 days after the crash-landing, animal abductions ceased and human abductions began. Early human abductions appear to have been random and opportunistic, but later ones have included a statistically disproportionate number of individuals with high socio-economic status, suggesting the aliens have adapted their methods and are now solely concerned with acquiring high-value targets.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the most likely explanation for this behavior is that the aliens intentions towards us are hostile – intelligence gathering at least, and hostile takeover or extermination at worst. Given their technological superiority, this is a worrying prospect. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMethods.ExploitCouncil=The aliens seem to be targeting people in positions of authority.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ExploitCouncil=Investigate Returned Abductees
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ExploitCouncil=A new and significant development – abduction victims reported missing have begun to reappear. This is highly suspicious and the Council has agreed that they must be placed under immediate surveillance. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ExploitCouncil=Perform Surveil Location missions in areas with a suspected alien presence. Send councilors on Investigate Alien Activity missions when you discover evidence of alien influence on the populace or leaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ExploitCouncil=We now have multiple, independent reports that the returned abduction victims are spying on high-level government, military, and economic affairs. Countries are being targeted indiscriminately, without concern for political stance or alliance. None of the returned abductees had any history of espionage or political activity.<br/><br/>With our assistance, local police have intercepted and detained several abductees in the middle of these missions. Even under harsh interrogation, they have without exception refused to divulge any explanation for their behavior. Their loyalty to their new masters is striking.<br/><br/>The alien ability to control their human subjects – for they are clearly behind this – is both impressive and frightening. How are they doing it? Is this some function of their advanced technology? Whatever the answers, our position appears grim. We need to learn more, and quickly – who knows how far the aliens' influence has already spread without our knowledge?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateEnthrallMission.ExploitCouncil=We should take care they don't attempt to penetrate our organization.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOperations.ExploitCouncil=Research Alien Operations
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOperations.ExploitCouncil=All evidence now suggests that the aliens have designs upon human governments. They are clearly spying upon human power structures – but why?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOperations.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Alien Operations" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.ExploitCouncil=We have our breakthrough, and the news is troubling. The countries previously targeted by alien abductions are now displaying sudden and dramatic shifts towards a pro-alien viewpoint, with key figures in public and private spheres disappearing or being fired while pro-alien figures take their place. Most disturbing are the cases where the figures are NOT being replaced, but are instead undergoing what can only be described as a total shift in personality. Public figures who in the past have advocated for nationalism, independence, or other ideologies are now suddenly declaring fervent support for the aliens. In several cases, figures who are (or were) sympathetic to our cause have undergone this sudden shift – in all cases, they have cut off communication immediately and refused to answer our requests for information.<br/><br/>It is clear that the aliens have some method of influencing or controlling humans that is beyond anything available to us. By our current projections, if they are left to expand their influence unchecked, they will come to dominate Earth in a few years at most. The alien method of influence is the key to this conflict, and all of our resources should be devoted towards understanding it.<br/><br/><h>We have activated an alien threat monitor that estimates the likelihood they are going to target our intrests directly. It is visible in the top-right of the main game view.</h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOperations.ExploitCouncil=This appears to be some kind of hostile takeover effort on the part of the aliens.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMovements.ExploitCouncil=Research Alien Movements
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMovements.ExploitCouncil=We now have the beginnings of a long-term strategy. We must understand the alien methods of influence, with a view towards countering them. As a first step towards this, we should develop a tracking network to monitor alien movements on Earth.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMovements.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Alien Movements" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMovements.ExploitCouncil=We have set up a new organization, drawing upon the resources of various multinational communication companies and national intelligence agencies, focused upon tracking the movements and activities of the alien agents upon Earth. This will assist us in countering alien attempts to sway Earth governments, but more importantly it should provide opportunities for us to acquire samples of alien technology or samples of aliens themselves.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMovements.ExploitCouncil=We've developed the capability to track the aliens.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOrigin.ExploitCouncil=Research Alien Origin
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOrigin.ExploitCouncil=Our understanding of the aliens is still extremely limited. While gaining a fuller understanding of their intentions and capabilities is still our priority, there may be some benefit to learning where they came from. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOrigin.ExploitCouncil=Research the Skywatch and Deep System Skywatch global technologies, and then the Alien Origin project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOrigin.ExploitCouncil=Through funds supplied to astronomical organizations, we have received copies of their reports. It appears that the aliens have a base of operations in the outer reaches of our Solar System. Presumably they travelled there with some kind of faster-than-light technology, then began to build up their ships and other hardware using locally sourced resources.<br/><br/>The astronomers seem largely interested in the alien faster-than-light tech and the implications for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. We do not have the luxury of wasting time on such unproductive subjects and as such will be focusing on more practical matters.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOrigin.ExploitCouncil=We believe we have located the alien headquarters inside the Solar System.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.AccessHydraCorpus.ExploitCouncil=Kill an alien
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.AccessHydraCorpus.ExploitCouncil=Now we have the ability to effectively track alien movements, we should acquire one for study. We see no reason to take the additional risk of keeping it alive.<br/><br/>We should, however, consider our timing of this operation carefully. We do not know how the aliens regard us as a competitor, but it is possible our assets will face retaliation from the aliens or their supporters.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.AccessHydraCorpus.ExploitCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct an Assassinate mission against it. It is possible assaulting alien installations on Earth or in space may also yield an alien body for study, but it is difficult to predict under what circumstances that might occur.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.AccessHydraCorpus.ExploitCouncil=The operation was delegated to our security division, which accomplished the mission to our satisfaction. We have acquired an alien corpse and transported it to a dedicated research facility for autopsy. Note: The alien was accompanied by several humans who appeared to function as its bodyguards; we have reason to believe that they may have had links to the faction identified as the Servants. Their bodies were disposed of.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.AccessHydraCorpus.ExploitCouncil=A satisfying result. Let's see what we can learn from the autopsy.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchHydraBiology.ExploitCouncil=Research Hydra Biology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchHydraBiology.ExploitCouncil=We finally have an intact alien corpse. Our hope is that the autopsy will suggest some lines of research. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchHydraBiology.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Hydra Biology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchHydraBiology.ExploitCouncil=Our autopsy has revealed little of direct use. The biologists and other scientists on our payroll have provided a long and frankly tedious report on the details of the anatomy of the alien species, henceforth codenamed "Hydras." Most of the information offers no opportunity for profit or strategic information, but one small detail has drawn our attention. The Hydra body appears to produce free-floating cells that in turn produce chemicals. Some of these chemicals are very similar to psychoactive drugs. If our findings are correct, this may have some connection to how the Hydras are capable of controlling their human servants.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchHydraBiology.ExploitCouncil=Perhaps there's an angle for our pharmaceutical division.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocytes.ExploitCouncil=Research Hydra Pherocytes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocytes.ExploitCouncil=The Hydras appear to produce a type of cells, dubbed "pherocytes," that can produce chemicals with psychoactive properties. This is currently our leading theory as to how they are able to influence humans so effectively. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocytes.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Hydra Pherocytes" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocytes.ExploitCouncil=Our suspicions have been confirmed; the alien pherocytes are the key to the Hydra ability to influence other species.<br/><br/>Hydra pherocytes are effectively miniature drug factories. They are produced within the Hydra's internal organs and released into the air, from where they can enter the bodies of other creatures via breathing or mucous membranes. Once there, they release chemicals directly into the brain. This effectively functions as biological mind control, similar in principle to our own techniques of medical and psychiatric medication, but vastly more advanced. With a sufficient dose, the pherocytes enable near-total control over the subject's behavior, even capable of forcing them to act against their core beliefs or instincts. The advantage this gives the Hydras is obvious. Each Hydra effectively functions as a living biological domination system, able to subvert any creature in its proximity.<br/><br/>There are, however, two reasons for (cautious) optimism. Firstly, while the Hydra pherocytes are highly complex and advanced, they are not radically different from the biological systems of living creatures on Earth. There is, at present, no obvious theoretical reason why it should be impossible for us to replicate Hydra pherocytes and employ their capabilities ourselves.<br/><br/>Second, the Hydras are not immune to their own pherocytes. While they appear to work differently on a Hydra subject as compared to a non-Hydra one, the same methods that allow the Hydras to control humans could, in theory, allow us to control Hydras. Much, however, remains to be done before we can approach this step.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocytes.ExploitCouncil=It seems every alien comes with its own marketing department.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienContainment.ExploitCouncil=Research Hydra Containment
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienContainment.ExploitCouncil=To continue our research on Hydra pherocytes, the scientists in our employ require a live subject for study. This will require the construction of a specialized containment facility.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienContainment.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Hydra Containment" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienContainment.ExploitCouncil=The containment facility was relatively easy to construct. The next step is to detain a Hydra subject.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienContainment.ExploitCouncil=We're ready to bring in an alien.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.CaptureAHydra.ExploitCouncil=Capture a Live Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.CaptureAHydra.ExploitCouncil=A live Hydra will allow us to study their pherocytes in more detail. There is also the possibility of communicating with a captive subject. As yet, the Hydras have proven singularly uninterested in negotiating with us; perhaps they will respond better to a more forceful approach.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.CaptureAHydra.ExploitCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct a Detain mission against it. It may also be possible to locate an Alien Facility in an Earth region and conduct an Assault Alien Asset mission against it or detect and capture an alien hab out in the Solar System.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.CaptureAHydra.ExploitCouncil=The Hydra was located and detained by our security division, who once again conducted themselves in a satisfactory manner. Unfortunately, the Hydra "servants" have become aware of our actions and have denounced our detainment of the Hydra as "blasphemy." It is becoming clear that any long-term solution to the Hydra issue will be unlikely so long as the Servant faction remains active.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.CaptureAHydra.ExploitCouncil=Our security team has brought home a live subject for testing.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.ExploitCouncil=Communicate with Captured Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.ExploitCouncil=Pherocyte research is underway, but our plans require a greater understanding of Hydra culture and organization. Developing a means of communication is the first step towards this. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.ExploitCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.ExploitCouncil=A team of linguists and biologists have assembled an apparatus which they claim will allow for crude communication with our captive Hydra. The details are (apparently) scientifically interesting but appear largely irrelevant, apart from the detail that the Hydra pherocytes also play a role in their own communications. This raises some intriguing possibilities.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.ExploitCouncil=We have exchanged simple communications with our alien subject.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=Salvage Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=While this organization has typically preferred to avoid direct military action, in this case it unfortunately appears that we have no realistic alternative. We require further samples of alien technology; engage an alien force and acquire them. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=Successfully engage one of the following alien assets: facility, landed UFO, orbital habitat, warship, or army and recover some of the detritus left behind.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=Our success against the aliens is heartening, and should provide some public relations leverage against the pro-alien factions. In the meantime, we will continue with our research.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=We have recovered samples of alien technology.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=Research Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=The alien technology carries the potential for enormously increased efficiency and profit. We have contacted some professionals in the field of industrial espionage and tasked them with reverse-engineering it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Alien Technology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=While our research has produced some results of mild interest, there are a notable lack of clear avenues by which we can exploit the alien designs. It appears that the majority of the alien technological superiority is due to some kind of high-tech alloys used extensively throughout their equipment. Our researchers have claimed that they require a larger quantity of these exotic alloys to learn anything further. Incentives and forceful encouragements directed towards our research teams have unfortunately failed to motivate them to do more with less. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienTechnology.ExploitCouncil=We have developed only limited opportunities for new products thus far.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.SalvageAlienWarship.ExploitCouncil=Salvage Alien Warship
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienWarship.ExploitCouncil=Given the disappointing performance of our research department, it appears that the most cost-effective means for advancing our research is to defeat and salvage an alien warship. Actuarial predictions suggest that such an engagement will likely cost us several of our own vessels with total losses of all of their crews. We consider this an acceptable trade.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienWarship.ExploitCouncil=Engage and defeat an alien warship, then research the "Alien Warships" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienWarship.ExploitCouncil=Congratulations on your successful engagement of the enemy. Personnel losses were 63.5 percent below our "average-case" predictions, meaning that the funds reserved for death benefits and recruitment of replacement personnel can now instead be reinvested in our new reverse-engineering projects. The Board would like to pass on their personal appreciation for your efforts.<br/><br/>Studying the wrecked alien warship has been illuminating, though not immediately profitable. Our research has confirmed that the alien technological superiority seems to rest almost entirely upon these unusual alloys, or "Exotics" as our researchers have named them. On the negative side, this means we have failed to generate any true breakthroughs from our reverse-engineering; on the positive side, it does seem likely that with access to these same materials, we should be able to approach or even match the aliens' capabilities. We should proceed with research to learn more.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SalvageAlienWarship.ExploitCouncil=We are coming to understand the alien technological superiority.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExotics.ExploitCouncil=Research Exotics
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExotics.ExploitCouncil=The alien Exotics are the key to their technological superiority. Could we discover some way to produce them ourselves?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExotics.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Exotic Materials" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExotics.ExploitCouncil=The alien Exotics are quite impressive. They allow the production of new materials which are superior to anything that can be manufactured upon Earth. Our R&D personnel have already suggested dozens of entirely new markets that could be opened using designs that are only possible with Exotic alloys. The potential for wealth creation is enormous.<br/><br/>Disappointingly, however, our researchers have been unable to suggest any viable way of reproducing these Exotics ourselves. Evidence suggests that producing them requires a large quantity of highly advanced infrastructure, which may be why the aliens have chosen to import them directly from their home. In the long term, matching the alien capabilities will require us to send teams to their native production facilities and study their industrial techniques in person. In the meantime, it has been suggested that we should "farm" Exotics from the aliens already present in our Solar System. Given their enormous value, even significant losses of ships and personnel in exchange for relatively small quantities of Exotics will still represent a favourable exchange. In light of this, the Board has authorised you to scale up our shipbuilding program.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExotics.ExploitCouncil=We will need to harvest more of these materials from alien spacecraft.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConductHydraInterrogation.ExploitCouncil=Now that we have our Hydra translation device, we are in a position to interrogate our captive Hydra. We are particularly interested in their culture and organizational structures. Though our research teams will continue to have access to our captive, we have subcontracted the actual interrogation to specialists in the field.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConductHydraInterrogation.ExploitCouncil=Complete the "Hydra Interrogation" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraInterrogation.ExploitCouncil=Our interrogations of our captive have been extensive and lengthy, and have produced a great deal of useful information.<br/><br/>The Hydras appear to operate from a basically logical and rational mindset. They have apparently taken significant damage from alien species in the past, and as a result have a cautious, defensive approach toward other races that emphasises control and self-protection. Unfortunately, despite their rationality, a negotiated settlement does not appear practical. The Hydras react extremely negatively to the possibility of any alien species possessing the potential to threaten them in the future – any kind of negotiated peace would require granting the Hydras an unacceptable level of control over this Council and humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>Hydra culture appears collectivist and consensus-driven, perhaps due to the influence of the Hydra pherocytes: they have strong tendencies towards hierarchy and order. In many ways, their society has much to admire: crime is almost unknown and Hydra workers appear on average significantly more efficient and productive than human ones, although perhaps less creative. Although our captive is only one individual, various data that we have gathered strongly suggests that its opinions are representative of its race as a whole – and indeed, that the same is likely to apply to any individual Hydra. Their unity, in combination with the role in Hydra society played by these pherocytes, suggests certain vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>In other, less important news, we have discovered the method behind Hydra interstellar travel: they use a technology previously believed to exist only in the realm of science fiction, a "wormhole." Further research is recommended.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocyteResistance.ExploitCouncil=Research Pherocyte Resistance
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocyteResistance.ExploitCouncil=Now that we have a better understanding of the mechanics of Hydra pherocytes, as well as a live subject to experiment on, we can proceed with a more focused study. The first step is understanding the Hydra pherocytes well enough to effectively counter them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocyteResistance.ExploitCouncil=Complete the "Pherocyte Resistance" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocyteResistance.ExploitCouncil=After some trial and error, our R&D department have discovered a number of compounds that are naturally occurring on Earth and relatively harmless to humans, but harmful or toxic to Hydra physiology. When injected into the bloodstream, they produce at most mild irritation in humans, but are destructive to Hydra cells, including pherocyte cells. We have formulated a long-lasting version of this cocktail which can be administered by syringe to our personnel and operatives. So long as it is topped up every few days, Hydra pherocytes introduced into the body will quickly die off, preventing the pherocytes from attaining the critical mass needed for effective mind control. It is a rather crude solution, but will suffice for now.<br/><br/>More importantly, our efforts in analyzing the nature of Hydra pherocytes has begun to yield results. We believe it should be theoretically possible to breed our own versions of pherocyte cells in a controlled environment.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocyteResistance.ExploitCouncil=Our research into the alien is finally returning favorable results and potential product lines.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocyteMastery.ExploitCouncil=Research Pherocyte Mastery
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocyteMastery.ExploitCouncil=The Hydras produce pherocytes within their own bodies. But there seems no theoretical reason why it should be impossible for us to produce them using our own bio-industrial base. Using the new technologies that have been developed in the wake of the Hydra arrival, we hope to develop a new, improved form of pherocyte which holds the potential to bring us success in this confrontation.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocyteMastery.ExploitCouncil=Complete the "Pherocyte Mastery" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocyteMastery.ExploitCouncil=The resource investment has been enormous, but I am pleased to report that our pherocyte project has finally borne fruit. Using micro-cultivation factories, we have developed portable units capable of mass-producing our own "neopherocytes" that produce mind-affecting substances to our own directions. Not only can we approximate the Hydra's ability to compel obedience, but we can do so significantly more quickly and in greater volume.<br/><br/>The neopherocytes do carry some drawbacks. Our artificial production systems unfortunately lack the thousands of years of evolution of the Hydra pherocytes, so they are somewhat less efficient; any given quantity of neopherocytes will be overridden by a similar quantity of their Hydra equivalent. This can, however, be compensated for by increasing the volume of the dose. A sufficiently large quantity of neopherocytes introduced into a Hydra system will drown out the native pherocytes and allow for control. Care must be taken not to overdose: we have discovered that a sufficient volume of neopherocytes can cause seizures and brain death. On a related note, our R&D department has requested new human and Hydra subjects for research.<br/><br/>Although it is early days, our neopherocytes appear to work quite effectively upon humans. We lack the ability to perform the "on-the-fly" adaption that the Hydras can accomplish, so we have had to program our neopherocytes more generally, aiming to encourage compliance with our representatives and contentment with the subject's station. We believe that with fine-tuning, we should be able to produce different strains of neopherocytes optimised for subjects in differing professions, encouraging varying traits to mold subjects into ideal workers. All of our strains have some tendency to suppress creativity and independence, but this seems an acceptable trade-off. On a related note, our research may have recreational applications; several of our personnel have individually approached us asking for modified neopherocyte strains for use upon subjects of romantic interest. This has the potential to be enormously profitable in the companionship industry. Once the Hydras are dealt with, of course.<br/><br/>On the negative side, it seems unlikely that the more pro-alien factions will be happy with our breakthrough. The "Servants" and "Protectorate," believing as they do in Hydra superiority, are likely to react extremely negatively. It seems increasingly probable that our relationship with these factions will end in direct conflict. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocyteMastery.ExploitCouncil=The opportunities from this line of investigation seem endless.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=Set Our Goals
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=Now that the stakes in this conflict are clear, we must decide upon our course of action. We face two separate and equally difficult problems: the alien invasion, and domestic resistance. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=Complete the "Means to an End" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=This has been one of the most contentious and difficult decisions our Board has ever faced, and the debates have been long and intense.<br/><br/>The alien invasion is, paradoxically, the simpler of the two problems. The aliens clearly intend to conquer the Earth and dominate humanity. Why they want this is a valid question, but ultimately a secondary one; this Board is not willing to cede authority over our world. As such, we must come to understand the alien plans, and stop them. Doing so will be difficult if not impossible, but is also a secondary concern: It is what must be done, therefore we will devote all our resources towards it.<br/><br/>The more contentious issue is the problem of domestic discord. Multiple factions have coalesced in response to the alien arrival, and political maps around Earth are being redrawn along pro-alien versus anti-alien lines. To further complicate the matter, we have breakaway factions agitating for wildly incompatible goals such as peaceful coexistence and wholesale evacuation.<br/><br/>Clearly, should the population of Earth continue to fight amongst themselves, alien victory is assured. As such, our second objective, running in parallel to the first, must be to unite human governmental and private resources behind our Council and broader organization. In an ideal world we would of course prefer to do this in a cooperative manner, but it seems highly unlikely that the various other factions will recognise our authority. As such, it may be necessary to compel their obedience. The alien methods of influence may be of assistance in this matter. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=Someone must lead humanity through this difficult time. No one has the talent, vision, or resources that we do.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchWormholes.ExploitCouncil=Research Wormholes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchWormholes.ExploitCouncil=Our interrogation of our captive has revealed that the Hydras came to our Solar System via a "wormhole." Since any long-term solution to the Hydra problem will require the pacification of those Hydras outside of our Solar System, we should look into the this wormhole's mechanics. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchWormholes.ExploitCouncil=Complete the "Wormholes" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchWormholes.ExploitCouncil=The Hydra wormhole represents a fascinating opportunity. It allows nothing less than direct, immediate access between our Solar System and theirs. While the researchers we have engaged for this project appear excited about the scientific implications, we have endeavoured to keep them focused on more practical matters.<br/><br/>While the wormhole presumably has some limitations, it is an incredibly powerful tool. Whoever holds the wormhole holds the only practical method of travel between our solar systems. Entire countries on Earth have built their economies on a single naval or land passage – this wormhole is a passage between two entire star systems! The trade value it could generate is literally astronomical.<br/><br/>Of course, at present the Hydras control the wormhole, so any potential benefit is moot. Nevertheless, we should work towards securing control over the wormhole at the earliest possible opportunity.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchWormholes.ExploitCouncil=Comparisons to the Silk Road or Panama Canal seem appropriate.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ExploitCouncil=Research the Alien Choke Point
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ExploitCouncil=Whoever controls the wormhole will be position to dominate both the Hydra solar system and our own for generations to come. We should continue our research. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ExploitCouncil=Complete the "The Choke Point" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ExploitCouncil=The wormhole, or the "Ellis Drainhole" as our researchers have classified it, is an impressive feat of engineering. While we are unable to build one of our own as yet, we have come to understand its mechanics. The wormhole can only transmit a relatively small total amount of mass in any given time period – teams of personnel are possible, entire space vessels are not. This explains why the Hydras were forced to construct their ships here rather than transfer them en masse from their own home.<br/><br/>Another curious feature is that the wormhole is asymmetrical – much more mass can be transferred from the Hydra system to ours than vice versa. The Hydras have taken advantage of this to supply their invasion, but it could also theoretically allow us to ship large quantities of high-value goods, such as Exotics, from the Hydra homeworld to Earth, assuming a colonial outpost could be set up to properly exploit the resources.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, our intelligence sources have learned that certain human factions have quite different plans for the wormhole – the self-styled "Resistance" want it not only shut down, but destroyed. Compromise seems unlikely.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienChokePoint.ExploitCouncil=Whoever controls this wormhole controls the future of humanity.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchEnslavetheMasters.ExploitCouncil=Prepare to Enslave the Masters
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchEnslavetheMasters.ExploitCouncil=We now have all that we need. Our research into the mechanics of the Hydra wormhole has confirmed that a small team should be able to pass through it to the Hydra system beyond. Once there, they will deploy neopherocytes to suborn the local Hydras, who will be recruited to our cause. These Hydras will spread our neopherocytes to other Hydras, and so on. Essentially we will execute the same plan upon the Hydras as they hoped to execute upon us. Many of our members consider this symmetry to be amusingly ironic.<br/><br/>In parallel to this, the time has finally come to make some permanent decisions concerning the other human factions. While a minority may be willing to accept our roll-out of the neopherocytes, it seems probable that the majority will not. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchEnslavetheMasters.ExploitCouncil=Research the "Prepare to Enslave the Masters" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchEnslavetheMasters.ExploitCouncil=Our Hydra infiltration team has been assembled. The process was straightforward, requiring only the development of some more advanced man-portable micro-factories. They should be able to mass-produce neopherocytes out of the materials available on the other side of the wormhole.<br/><br/>Planning for the other factions and sub-factions has proven more complex. At present, our "best-fit" solutions are as follows:<br/><br/>HUMANITY FIRST: While they have a certain reflexive hostility towards private corporations, the prospect of taking control over the Hydras as they attempted to do to us appears to appeal to the HF rank-and-file. As such, we anticipate that a significant fraction of HF will be amenable to joining us.<br/>THE RESISTANCE: This faction appears devoted both to destroying the Hydra wormhole, and to maintaining a traditionalist power structure in Earth governance. As such, despite their opposition to the Hydras, it appears they must be liquidated.<br/>PROJECT EXODUS: While their obsession with building a colony ship is somewhat ridiculous, it does at least show vision. The prospect of interstellar colonization may function in the future as a useful "safety valve" for redirecting problematic elements among the Earth population. They are also the most corporate-friendly of the factions. A negotiated settlement should be viable.<br/>THE ACADEMY: The Academy have consistently treated us with hostility, declaring on multiple occasions that we are "no better" than the Hydras. They appear entirely intractable, not to mention woefully naive. We recommend that they be liquidated.<br/>THE PROTECTORATE: The core membership of this faction appears to consist of ideologues. However, it appears that many others have been attracted to the faction by the prospect of exercising power over a subservient class. The ideologues should be liquidated, but the more cynical members should make predictable, if limited, employees.<br/>THE SERVANTS: Their entire ideology is based around a fanatical religious devotion to alien supremacy. Liquidate without exception.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchEnslavetheMasters.ExploitCouncil=We have reached the point of no return.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=Earth is Not Enough
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=We have assembled all we need to execute a hostile takeover, not only of the Hydra invasion force, but of the Hydra empire itself. The wormhole is the key. Deploy our infiltration team to the Hydra wormhole base, send them through to the Hydra homeworld, and complete our conquest.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target the alien wormhole module at their primary Kuiper Belt base with the {winnerOrgMission} mission.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ExploitVictory.ExploitCouncil=I am pleased to report that the operation has been an unqualified success.<br/><br/>Our infiltration team was deployed to the wormhole without significant incident; losses to our fleet were acceptable. Once through the wormhole, they were quickly able to subvert the Hydras occupying the base built around the wormhole's other end, and found more gates nearby. After multiple hops between alien stations, they found the Hydra home system. According to the reports we have received, the bulk of the Hydra population is concentrated in orbital habs around the (currently uninhabitable) Hydra homeworld; this allowed our neopherocytes to quickly spread through Hydra society.<br/><br/>By our current estimates, approximately 70 percent of the original Hydra (pre-invasion) population is currently under our control. Another 25 percent were unfortunately lost when it became necessary to eliminate several orbital habs that had closed themselves off to neopherocyte inflow. Our R&D department assures us that the Hydra population has more than sufficient genetic diversity to absorb these losses. The remaining 5 percent of holdouts are resisting for now, but are cut off from their base of support and infrastructure and are not anticipated to be a major threat. The Hydra military and administrative facilities are under our control; we effectively rule the Hydra home system of Delta Pavonis, and through it, their interstellar empire.<br/><br/>Now that the Hydras have been dealt with, this only leaves the issue of other human factions, and I am happy to report that plans for resolving this are well under way. Neopherocyte deployment will allow us to rapidly compromise known enemy agents, which will in turn allow us to spread our influence further. We anticipate that we should have effective control over Earth within a matter of months, with up to a year budgeted for tracking down recalcitrants. As previously discussed, our current projections indicate that the Academy, Resistance, and Servant factions will have to be eliminated entirely.<br/><br/>Looking forward, this Council believes that the era of nation-states is over. Most national governments upon Earth have by this point been toppled or reduced to puppets, and those that have survived the chaos of the invasion and our own neopherocyte sweep are likely to dwindle further into insignificance. Our analysts believe (correctly, in my view) that there is no reason to eliminate remaining governmental organizations. We see no reason not to pay lip service to their claims of authority; any presidents or other leaders who attempt to press those claims upon us will have the realities of the situation quietly explained to them.<br/><br/>Our neopherocytes combined with our command of the wormhole and of Hydra society gives us an unprecedented level of influence over human affairs, and we are already drawing up plans to make use of this in a new "Society 2.0." Neopherocytes will enable us to optimize workers for industries and market sectors that have traditionally been seen as undesirable or low-status; our new working class will be far more productive and happier in their station. Promising individuals can then be selected on a meritocratic basis and promoted to the administrative class, where they will be free to focus on higher-level matters. Of course, some amount of crime and social disorder is a permanent feature of human society, so we feel it is more realistic to confine such behavior to designated areas rather than attempt to eliminate it entirely. Such non-corporate, "free zones" should act as a useful incentive to encourage the populace to take up employment in our organizations. We anticipate that surviving members of the other factions may linger for some time as resistance movements or terrorist groups, but so long as they are confined to Earth, this should not pose a serious threat to our new, more advanced and productive society.<br/><br/>The future is bright, both for this Council, and for humanity as a whole.

TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.CooperateCouncil=The disappearances are worrying not in their number – humans kill each other in greater numbers on an hourly basis – but in what they imply. Abductions imply research, imply selection, but they are actions one performs upon lesser creatures. We capture a shark or a rare bird for study; we do not do the same to our neighbor. As yet many people still hold out the hope of cooperation with the aliens, but as this news spreads their numbers will plummet. Our list of allies may soon grow thin indeed.

For now, let us hope that somewhere in this great list lie the answers we seek.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMethods.CooperateCouncil=Research the "Alien Methods" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMethods.CooperateCouncil=The alien abductions follow a clear pattern. At first animals were taken – dogs, pigs, goats. After nine days these abruptly ceased and from then on all disappearances were human. This gradually transitioned into a third wave of abductions, this time directed at important or influential targets, particularly in the media, political, and technical spheres.<br/><br/>The most likely explanation for this pattern is that the animal abductions were for broad-based biological study (Earth-general), the second wave was for narrow biological study (human-specific), and the third represents an attempt (or the beginning of a larger-scale attempt) to gain influence.<br/><br/>There is no plausible "friendly" explanation for these actions.<br/><br/>Discord is spreading. The more vociferously pro- and anti-alien elements within our ranks are engaging in angry arguments, even coming to blows. Both have demanded that we change our official policy to one more amenable to them. I have stated that we are still attempting to hold a middle-ground position; I am sure this will satisfy neither.

Still, a few have stayed loyal, for which I am grateful. It was one of those teams that was able to solve this particular puzzle.<br/><br/>A middle-ranking civil servant with no prior history of violence or political extremism was discovered gathering information on the residences and personal security of his superiors; from context, the information was clearly for the purposes of kidnapping, if not outright assassination. Two similar cases in the same country were also detected. The civil servant was a previous abduction victim, and to all appearances, he is now assisting his former captors. Why? And more importantly – if we were able to catch these three, how many more are taking place without our knowledge?<br/><br/>Our theories and debates now seem woefully outdated.

TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.CooperateCouncil=From the beginning, the clandestine, aggressive nature of the alien actions was a puzzle. For if they were hostile, why take the trouble to make landfall? Even the most aggressively anti-alien voices within our debates have admitted that should the aliens wish to eliminate us, they could do so with little difficulty. We are at the bottom of a gravity well, they at the top; the disparity in power is enormous.<br/><br/>Yet the aliens have made no moves towards open violence. The two most likely explanations: they have stayed their hand due to ethical concerns, or they seek to exploit us. Unfortunately, the second now appears the more likely. Countries are rapidly falling under alien sway, with governments and leaders being subverted or directly controlled. Perhaps we should be grateful that the alien intend conquest rather than xenocide, but as things stand it is small comfort.<br/><br/>What do the aliens hope to achieve by taking control of our planet? What benefit could a subjugated species bring? As yet we have many questions and few answers. All we can do is continue to study their actions, in the hope that some key will be revealed.<br/><br/><h>We have activated an alien threat monitor that estimates the likelihood they are going to target our intrests directly.

An unglamorous end, but perhaps the only achievable one.<br/><br/>Opposed is the "war" faction. They argue that the aliens are clearly and openly hostile, and that we have no choice but to resist. Reports have surfaced of other alien species, used as expendable cannon fodder; should we surrender, humanity's fate is likely to be no better. Resistance at least offers some slim chance of freedom; surrender means a bleak and certain fate.<br/><br/>And then there are the few remaining holdouts, like me, who still hope for some cooperative resolution. Is it possible? Or are we the greatest fools of all?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchCooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=Complete the "A Cooperative Resolution" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchCooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=There has, at least, been one benefit to our drop in support; it has made our arguments more civilized. Most of the hardliners have abandoned us, joining the bleed-off to the Resistance, to the Servants, to Humanity First, even to the shadowy organization known as the Initiative. Those who remain are a small tight-knit group, held together not so much by ideology as by loyalty and determination.<br/><br/>But we have reached a consensus. We will pursue two approaches simultaneously.<br/><br/>Firstly, we will use our links to the Servants and other pro-alien groups to attempt to contact the aliens and open negotiations. Ideally, this will result in a negotiated peace, but we recognise that this is unlikely. Our position is too weak and there is little reason for the aliens to end a war that they are clearly winning. Realistically, our best hope is to gain a clearer picture of who they are and what they want.<br/><br/>Secondly and simultaneously, we will work to strengthen our own position. This will require cooperation with the resistance factions to engage in guerrilla warfare against the aliens, with the goal of learning more about their species and reverse-engineering their technology. We will build up our space fleet, our control over the Solar System, and our military technology, with the hope of eventually using this as leverage to force the aliens to the negotiating table, and taking us more seriously this time.<br/><br/>And should that fail, we will be forced back to our initial positions. Surrender, or fight to the last. At which point our group will certainly fracture for good.<br/><br/>I tremble at the audacity of what we propose. Attempting to reach a permanent peace while simultaneously keeping our own independence is without question the most difficult path. Should we fail, we will become a footnote in history, dismissed as idealistic fools. Only time will tell if they are right.

The scientific implications of either are profound, but for now we have, unfortunately, more pressing concerns.<br/><br/>The aliens have set up orbital habitations around various bodies in our Solar System, which they are using as staging points. It seems they intend to stay here for some time. This does at least imply some level of investment on their part, as opposed to a more short-term and destructive agenda, but their longer-term intentions are still a worrying mystery.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOrigin.CooperateCouncil=We have completed our analysis on the alien base in the outer Solar System, Chancellor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.AccessHydraCorpus.CooperateCouncil=Access an Alien Corpus
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.AccessHydraCorpus.CooperateCouncil=While our attempts to contact the aliens continue, we will pursue a parallel, more aggressive approach. Any long-term truce with the aliens will require us to be able to effectively defend ourselves against their ability to subvert humans, and doing this will require us to understand their biology. An autopsy on a corpse is a necessary first step. This unfortunately will require us to produce such a corpse ourselves.<br/><br/>This step is a risky one. It will certainly damage our relations with pro-alien factions, and it carries the extreme danger of antagonising the aliens directly; We are uncomfortably aware of how vulnerable we still are. But we desperately need to know more.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.AccessHydraCorpus.CooperateCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct an Assassinate mission against it. It is possible assaulting alien installations on Earth or in space may also yield an alien body for study, but it is difficult to predict under what circumstances that might occur.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.AccessHydraCorpus.CooperateCouncil=The operation was as ugly and bloody as we expected. The alien was protected by human bodyguards, which our team was forced to engage. I say "forced," but in truth, this was our decision. We now have both human and alien blood on our hands, and I fear this is only the start of a long and dark road. The aliens and their supporters will view us as terrorists, and I cannot say they are entirely wrong.<br/><br/>We took casualties as well, of course. On my insistence, our team announced their presence to the alien and its bodyguards and offered terms of surrender. The offer was ignored and the negotiator who made the offer was killed in the ensuing firefight. The second-in-command of the team has flatly told me that they could have completed the mission without casualties had they been authorised to strike first. I would like to say I regret the order, but in all honesty, I would give the same command again.<br/><br/>Still, we have our corpse. I hope the information our biologists can glean from it is worth the price we paid.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.AccessHydraCorpus.CooperateCouncil=We have secured an alien corpse, Chancellor. I only hope the price was worth it.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchHydraBiology.CooperateCouncil=Research Hydra Biology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchHydraBiology.CooperateCouncil=The culture and ways of thinking of all Earth creatures are rooted first and foremost in their bodies; their biology, physiology, genetics. For all their differences, I believe these aliens must be the same. Let us see what we can learn.<br/><br/>Our personnel have begun to refer to these creatures as "Hydras," after the speed with which their influence grows and regrows across the Earth; removing any of their servants only leads to two more taking their place. In the Greek myth, the hero sent to slay the Hydra succeeded only by dismembering it piece by piece and burning the remains. I hope this is not an omen.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchHydraBiology.CooperateCouncil=Research the "Hydra Biology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchHydraBiology.CooperateCouncil=An autopsy is a poor substitute for a diplomatic exchange; still, we have learned much.<br/><br/>Hydras are strong – both larger and more physically powerful than humans – and far more resilient. They have a redundant organ system that makes them quite difficult to kill, and a wounded Hydra can recover from almost any injury. Oddly, despite their strength, their biology does not seem well adapted towards personal combat. Their size and muscle mass still make them dangerous, but less so than a human of similar size and strength would be. They lack natural weapons, just as we do, but unlike us their tool-using appendages seem less optimized for use of clubs or spears, and they do not appear to possess the stamina that our ancestors used to run down prey. Although it is dangerous to speculate too far, it does appear as though while they are capable of violence, they have chosen to specialize evolutionarily in other directions.<br/><br/>Hydra biology is complex and energy-intensive, requiring a great deal of time to grow and develop. The corpse we studied appears to be over 100 years old, and we speculate that a lifespan of 200 years is not impossible. Species is sequentially hermaphroditic, acquiring sexual characteristics only late in life. The slow growth rate, maturation cycle, and litter size would push the species towards caution and risk-aversion ... perhaps an explanation for their tendency to rely upon others? The lack of sexual differentiation may also correlate with a somewhat more uniform society.<br/><br/>The most important discovery, however, is a set of organs capable of producing aerosol factory cells. If our theories are correct, this is how the Hydras are able to control their human slaves, and carries profound implications for our future relations with their species.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchHydraBiology.CooperateCouncil=From our studies of the alien's remains we can hear the faintest whisper of their society, Chancellor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchPherocytes.CooperateCouncil=Research Hydra Pherocytes
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchPherocytes.CooperateCouncil=The Hydra "pherocytes" explain the odd, pheromone-like signatures that have been reported in areas of Hydra activity. They clearly have some ability to influence behavior. Perhaps this is the missing link we have been searching for. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchPherocytes.CooperateCouncil=Research the "Hydra Pherocytes" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchPherocytes.CooperateCouncil=Now much has become clear.<br/><br/>Hydra pherocytes are adaptive mind control agents. They are released into the air, are inhaled or ingested into the target's bloodstream, and travel from there to the brain, where they suppress the target's desires and loyalties and replace them with new directions, effectively enslaving them. They are clearly a natural evolution, rather than the result of bioengineering.<br/><br/>The implications are enormous. For Hydras, taming and controlling other species would be as instinctive as language or tool use is to us. They would have developed advanced techniques of animal husbandry before inventing fire, or the wheel. This would in turn have shaped their entire culture. To Hydras, other species are not rivals, or companions; they are first and foremost resources, to be tamed and trained. When Hydras look at humans, their first instinct must be to view us as we would view a feral dog or cat.<br/><br/>It feels sometimes as though all of our research since first contact has been one piece of bad news after another. How can we possibly negotiate with creatures who view us as we would a stray pet? The task seems overwhelming, yet it must start with a better understanding of the Hydra pherocytes.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchPherocytes.CooperateCouncil=Chancellor, we believe we have found the missing piece to understanding the Hydra behavior.

TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienContainment.CooperateCouncil=We have our prison, reinforced against both Hydra strength and Hydra pherocytes. Now we need an inmate. I wonder whether this will damage our relationship with the pro-alien factions less than simply killing a Hydra, or more.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.CaptureAHydra.CooperateCouncil=Capture a Live Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.CaptureAHydra.CooperateCouncil=Our relations with the pro-alien factions are already strained, but I expect this will push them to breaking point. Looked at objectively, it is only symmetrical. They have abducted us; now it is our turn to do the same to them. But I doubt fairness ranks high among their concerns. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.CaptureAHydra.CooperateCouncil=Detect an alien operative on Earth and conduct a Detain mission against it. It may also be possible to locate an Alien Facility in an Earth region and conduct an Assault Alien Asset mission against it or detect and capture an alien hab out in the Solar System.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.CaptureAHydra.CooperateCouncil=The fight was neither neat nor pretty, but we have our Hydra. This time we were better prepared, due to our analysis of Hydra biology, and the price in blood was lower, although still too high. The Hydra took some wounds in the fighting, but like its namesake, it is quickly regenerating.<br/><br/>We have assigned some personnel in an attempt to begin to build rapport with our captive. I imagine that its first response will be to attempt to enslave them with its pherocytes. Perhaps once this fails, it may start to take us more seriously. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.CaptureAHydra.CooperateCouncil=We have a live Hydra in our custody, Chancellor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.CooperateCouncil=Learn Their Language
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.CooperateCouncil=For our plan to have any chance of working, we must acquire real fluency with the Hydra language. Both the pro- and anti-alien factions are developing their own crude methods of communicating with the aliens; our objectives require something more sophisticated.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.CooperateCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.CooperateCouncil=We had expected the Hydra language to be more sophisticated than ours. The truth – interestingly – has turned out to be the exact opposite. The grammar of the Hydra language resembles a simpler version of Mandarin or Cantonese, and compared to the intricate rules of English it is remarkably straightforward. The sounds are of course impossible to produce with human vocal chords, but this is easily solved by audio playback. To our linguists, raised on the enormous variety and complexity of Earth languages, deciphering the rules of Hydra speech has been quite easy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the reason the Hydra language is so simple is that it is designed to work in conjunction with Hydra pherocytes. Hydra pherocyte communication provides the emotional depth and sophistication that their auditory language lacks; the words alone are more of a skeleton, with pherocytes providing context and intent. Communicating audio-only with a Hydra is the equivalent of speaking atonal Chinese, or English with a vocabulary limited to perhaps a few hundred nouns and verbs. Still, crude communication is better than nothing.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.CooperateCouncil=We are making progress understanding the Hydra spoken language, Chancellor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienTechnology.CooperateCouncil=In the long term, we hope to come to some kind of cooperative agreement with the aliens. In the short term, however, no matter our path, we will need a better understanding of the alien technology. To do so, we will need samples; unfortunately, the only viable way to obtain them appears to be by force. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienTechnology.CooperateCouncil=Successfully engage one of the following alien assets: facility, landed UFO, orbital habitat, warship, or army, then research the Alien Technology project when it becomes available.

TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienTechnology.CooperateCouncil=Research the "Alien Technology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienTechnology.CooperateCouncil=The tools of our invaders begin to give up their secrets. Every day, I come to my desk to read excited messages from our research teams about how they have discovered the workings of some new piece of machinery. They talk elatedly about the new devices we might create, the new ships we might build. I find it all depressing.<br/><br/>Hardly any of our researchers seem to grasp the distinction between science and technology. Yes, we are learning the mechanics of the alien designs, their mechanisms and working patterns, but we lack the theoretical framework that allowed the aliens to conceive these designs in the first place. Without a proper scientific understanding, we are merely aping their efforts. But more importantly, our researchers seem so drawn to the prospect of technological power that they are sparing no attention as to what it might be used for. Science and technology, divorced from culture and civilization, are mindless monsters. After all, the aliens have these technologies too, and what have they used them for? Conquest, war, and death. I fear that should we attempt to emulate the aliens' tools, we may become little different from them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienTechnology.CooperateCouncil=We are making progress understanding the alien artifacts, Chancellor, although most seem to be tools of warfare.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SalvageAlienWarship.CooperateCouncil=Predictably, to continue our understanding of the alien tools, we must mirror their own behavior. To build ships that can match the alien vessels, we must engage one of their ships in combat, destroy it, and strip the remains. Our crews are ready for an engagement. Should we succeed, many of them will die. Should we fail, almost all will. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SalvageAlienWarship.CooperateCouncil=Engage and defeat an alien warship.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SalvageAlienWarship.CooperateCouncil=Our military arm has defeated an alien warship. We have a wrecked ship full of dead aliens as our prize. Our own losses mirror theirs. Despite the death toll, morale is high. Perhaps in the far future, military historians will remember this day as the birth of a naval tradition.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchExotics.CooperateCouncil=Research Exotics
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchExotics.CooperateCouncil=For some time now, it has been clear that the greatest scientific gap between us and the aliens is in the realm of materials science. Now that we have alien technology to study, we can perhaps narrow that gap.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExotics.CooperateCouncil=Research the "Exotic Materials" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExotics.CooperateCouncil=The alien Exotics are clearly the product of a far greater understanding of physics and chemistry than ours. I had – perhaps foolishly – hoped that their study might give us some clues to the theories that the aliens must have used to design them, but this has been in vain. It was an optimistic hope; our own history shows that true understanding of new branches of science is the work of decades or centuries.<br/><br/>Still, we have reached a crude understanding of the alien Exotics, enough to begin employing them in our own construction. With no means of producing them, however, we remain dependent on the aliens for our supply. Perhaps, should we survive this war, we can found a new field of study devoted to understanding what our alien visitors can afford to throw away so casually.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchExotics.CooperateCouncil=We are making progress understanding alien engineering, Chancellor, but some of the underlying science still eludes us.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ConductHydraInterrogation.CooperateCouncil=Question the captive Hydra
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConductHydraInterrogation.CooperateCouncil=Now that we have both a Hydra and a means of communicating with it, we can attempt a proper conversation. Unfortunately our translation methods are still crude; we expect this to be a long process. Hopefully "Rudi," as one of our security personnel has named him, will be willing to talk.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConductHydraInterrogation.CooperateCouncil=Complete the "Hydra Interrogation" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraInterrogation.CooperateCouncil="Rudi" was indeed willing to talk, and we have learned a great deal. The summary report from the head of our translation team follows below, with attached notes.<br/><br/>——————————<br/><br/>Q. General request for our prisoner to introduce himself.<br/>A. The Hydra identified himself by what was (presumably) a name and an organizational position. He is apparently a diplomat/bio-engineer/animal handler. Apparently the three roles have considerable overlap within Hydra society. (Translator's Note: The Hydra's name is utterly unpronounceable. For the sake of our larynxes we're going to just keep on calling him Rudi.)<br/><br/>Q. Why has your species come to our solar system?<br/>A. For the purposes of [untranslatable verb] humans and other Earth-native species.<br/><br/>Q. Please define [untranslatable verb].<br/>A. (Translator's Note: This took a long time to interpret. The verb the Hydra used appears to mean a combination of risk analysis, animal taming, and resource exploitation. The fact that Hydras have a single word for all three is quite revealing. The closest English term is probably "domesticate").<br/><br/>Q. Why are you attempting to domesticate our species?<br/>A. Humanity has been classified by [untranslatable proper noun 1] as a class IV [untranslatable – some sort of scale] species.<br/><br/>Q. Please explain.<br/>A. Protocol of [untranslatable proper noun 2] requires that all extraterrestrial species of class III and higher be domesticated upon first contact.<br/><br/>Q. Please define [untranslatable proper noun 2].<br/>A. (Translator's Note: interpreting this term was both fascinating and frustratingly difficult. What Rudi described over the next hour appeared to be a cross between a political movement, a philosophy, and a security organization. Our best translation would be "defense consensus.")<br/><br/>Q. Are you a member of the Hydra defense consensus?<br/>A. All Hydra follow the defense consensus.<br/><br/>Q. Are there any means by which we could negotiate with the leaders of your defense consensus?<br/>A. No.<br/><br/>Q. Are there any other Hydra [factions] besides the defense consensus?<br/>A. No.<br/><br/>Q. Are there some outcomes that the defense consensus would accept other than human domestication?<br/>A. No.<br/><br/>Q. We do not wish to be domesticated.<br/>A. (Translator's Note: humor is notoriously difficult to translate, but I strongly suspect that the Hydra's reaction to this statement, and our follow-ups along the same lines, was amusement. Regardless, we didn't get anything helpful.)<br/><br/>The interrogation continued for another hour but little further progress was made.<br/><br/>Translator's Note: General reactions are mixed. "Rudi" is quite willing to talk, perhaps out of simple boredom, as he has had little interaction except with the security personnel detailed to his confinement chamber. His manner is also neither hostile nor particularly aggressive. However, he clearly has no interest in treating with us as equals. He apparently views our requests for negotiation as we would treat a diplomatic request from a German Shepherd. We will continue our efforts.

TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraDiplomacy.CooperateCouncil=The reception to our request has not been encouraging. Our first messages to the Hydras were simply ignored. On questioning our Servant contacts, we discovered that this was not unusual. The Hydras have little interest in communicating with the bulk of their "subjects," and prefer to disseminate messages through a small elite of trusted servants. Such servants are, naturally, under the Hydra's full control.<br/><br/>Not being members of the Hydra "elite," our only recourse has been to ask our contacts in the Servants to vouch for us; this has been a slow process and has strained our already tenuous relationship with their faction to the breaking point. But we have success, after a sort; a message has been sent to us stating that the Hydras will issue an official statement to our faction. However, the fact that it is described as a statement and not a dialogue is not encouraging.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirDemands.CooperateCouncil=The Hydras have agreed to issue a statement to our faction in "simplified Hydra." We hope to translate it and then engage them in a dialogue.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirDemands.CooperateCouncil=Complete the "Research Their Demands" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirDemands.CooperateCouncil=We have translated the Hydra statement. Calling it a "statement" is, unfortunately, inaccurate. It is in fact a list of demands.<br/><br/>1. Humanity is to cease all military operations against Hydra forces and place all their forces under the command of Hydra-appointed representatives.<br/>2. Humanity is to commit to building no space fleet, weapons of mass destruction, or other military assets that could present a threat to the Hydra race. Any such weapons in existence must be turned over to Hydra-appointed representatives.<br/>3. Humans will commit to supporting the Hydra race in any and all future endeavors or military conflicts. A standing human force will be raised and trained to serve under Hydra handlers in future operations.<br/>4. To ensure that points 2. and 3. are carried out, orbital weapons platforms will be placed in low Earth orbit carrying sufficient firepower to suppress any possible human resistance. These weapons platforms will be placed under the control of Hydra-appointed representatives.<br/><br/>We attempted to negotiate in response to these demands. Our messages received no reply.<br/><br/>The mood among our people is bleak. The more anti-alien members of our faction have been saying, in so many words, "we told you so." The alien demands are not merely for surrender, but for complete and total subjugation.<br/><br/>All of our attempts to re-open negotiations have been met with silence. We are at a diplomatic brick wall and I fear there is no path forward. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirDemands.CooperateCouncil=I suppose the silver lining is that they bothered to communicate with us at all, Chancellor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirPurpose.CooperateCouncil=Determine Their Purpose
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirPurpose.CooperateCouncil=Our "official" interrogations with our captive Hydra have brought only limited success. However, the head of our translation team has a suggestion. For some reason, our Hydra appears to have taken a certain liking to one of our security personnel, William Parker (the same one who named him Rudi). It has been suggested that some more informal conversations might be productive.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirPurpose.CooperateCouncil=Complete the "Their Purpose" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirPurpose.CooperateCouncil=Report from the head of our translation team is attached.<br/><br/>——————————<br/><br/>Despite objections from the more credentialed members of our team, I have allocated William Parker two hours per day to communicate with Rudi. We placed no restrictions on what topics were to be discussed, apart from the most basic ones concerning military security. The results were surprising.<br/><br/>Rudi, though unwilling to discuss anything that he considers a military or state secret, has been quite willing to talk about the history of his species. The Hydras apparently evolved upon an old planet, with a single supercontinent upon a vast ocean – an ocean that contained the majority of the world's natural resources but also teemed with deadly predators. The Hydras domesticated various amphibian species, and used them to scavenge and mine resources from the seabed. Apparently the Hydras developed close, and even sometimes fond, relationships with these species; their civilization was built upon them, and once their genetic science advanced sufficiently they uplifted many of them to near-human intelligence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this state of affairs did not last: the Hydras had only recently discovered spaceflight when their world was devastated by an interstellar weapon launched at their planet by a third sapient species. Ninety-nine percent of the entire Hydra race died instantly, taking with them much of Hydra history and culture. The only groups to survive were those off-planet, in the Hydra's space habs and colonies. The Cataclysm, as it is known, seems to dominate what remains of Hydra culture. The species responsible for the Cataclysm is one we are already aware of; these are the Hydra slave warriors known as "salamanders." The first action of the Hydra Defense Consensus was to neutralize and subjugate the salamanders, and their entire reason for existence is to ensure that nothing like the Cataclysm can ever happen again.<br/><br/>——————————<br/><br/>This explains a great deal. Now the rigid, untrusting nature of the responses we have received to our diplomatic exchanges can be understood in context. Hydra paranoia towards other species is understandable – the question is, how can we overcome it?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirPurpose.CooperateCouncil=We now understand why they are here, Chancellor.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirWeakness.CooperateCouncil=Learn Their Weakness
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirWeakness.CooperateCouncil=Our negotiations with the Hydras have hit a brick wall. The aliens apparently have neither motivation nor desire to compromise.<br/><br/>Diplomacy historically has been less a matter of enlightened reason and more a matter of compromise made under the threat of mutual destruction. It seems we will need some leverage.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirWeakness.CooperateCouncil=Complete the "Their Weakness" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirWeakness.CooperateCouncil=This has been one of our more uncomfortable projects. Trying to figure out some way to force the Hydras to the negotiating table has led us down dark paths.<br/><br/>In the end, the solution came, once again, from our expatriates. Some of the more anti-alien members that left our faction have migrated to a faction known as Humanity First, led by a figure known as Colonel Castillo. Humanity First are not satisfied with merely defeating the Hydras. They want to kill them – all of them – and have conceived of biological weapons with which they hope to wipe out the Hydra race entirely.<br/><br/>Humanity First believes that the Hydra pherocytes can be used as a point of vulnerability, allowing direct access into the Hydra brain and immune system. Our researchers have looked at the HF data, and, though they lack sufficient expertise to say for sure, they believe that HF's designs have the potential to work.<br/><br/>Obviously, we do not wish for this plan to proceed. Even apart from the ethical concerns, the deployment of this kind of bioweapon would represent a further escalation in the human-Hydra war that would in all probability end with the extinction of our species, their species, or both of us. The threat of such an attack, however, might be the leverage we have lacked and needed. This kind of brinkmanship is an extremely dangerous game, but we are at this point out of options.<br/><br/>We will set our researchers to work on developing a proof-of-concept bioweapon. I hope we are not making a terrible mistake.

Weekly injections into the bloodstream provide effective immunity to the Hydra pherocytes. It is a crude solution, but an effective one.<br/><br/>The manufacturers of the anti-pherocyte compound, as it turns out, are quite happy to supply us with their prototypes, despite our ideological differences ... so long as we are willing to pay their extortionate price.

We could – in theory – take advantage of the Hydra wormhole to contact the Hydra leadership directly. The problems with this plan are obvious and massive. Yet it represents our only reasonable chance of achieving a permanent peace, and there is a new energy and commitment among our personnel. Let us get to work.

Now it is time to put everything together.<br/><br/>By proving that we have the ability to genuinely threaten the Hydra species, yet also demonstrating a willingness for a peaceful solution, we hope to bring them to the negotiating table and end this war for good. The risks are great, yet the rewards should we succeed are greater.<br/><br/>The first step will be Rudi.

Security Officer Palmer, given his apparent level of rapport with our Hydra captive, was chosen to present our case.<br/><br/>Rudi's first reaction was, as expected, to refuse. We presented to him our blueprint for a bioweapon using modified Hydra cells. The weapon would take advantage of the behavioral effects of Hydra pherocytes to accelerate its spread, leading to an estimated 99 percent fatality rate upon infection. According to our projections, it would at the very least inflict significant population damage, and at most would wipe out the Hydra race entirely.<br/><br/>Our presentation is, at least partly, a bluff. We lack the biowarfare expertise to actually produce such a virus. Still, while we could not manufacture such a weapon, other humans could, and to the Hydras that is much the same thing. For the first time Rudi demonstrated signs of genuine fear. When we presented our offer to him – that he act as our go-between in opening negotiations – he agreed with little argument.<br/><br/>We have our strategy, we have the knowledge of where we must go, and we have a Hydra who is, however shakily, recruited to our cause. We are as ready as we will ever be.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAPermanentPeace.CooperateCouncil=Everything is in place, Chancellor. Once our fleet arrives at the alien base and our troops secure it, our envoys are prepared to go through.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.CooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=Send our Envoys Through The Wormhole
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.CooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=Our plan is reasonably simple, though highly dangerous.<br/><br/>1. We have assembled an envoy team. It consists of Rudi the Hydra, Security Officer William Parker, the head of our translation team, two diplomats, and one other security officer, all humans having been injected with a double dose of the anti-pherocyte serum. According to our calculations they should be able to pass through the wormhole without exceeding its mass limit.<br/>2. Our fleet must secure the space around the Hydra base.<br/>3. Marine forces will occupy the base itself and take control of the wormhole apparatus. We will announce to the Hydra garrison that we only wish to negotiate and will offer assurances that no Hydras on the base will be harmed should they let us pass. We do not expect this offer to be accepted.<br/>4. Our envoy team will pass through the wormhole.<br/>5. Once on the wormhole's other side, our envoy team will attempt to make contact with the Hydra leadership. Rudi's presence will be crucial here. According to Rudi, internal violence among Hydras is rare, and the Hydras on the other side will probably attempt to communicate with him rather than shooting first. Probably.<br/>6. Our envoy team will attempt to broker a truce.<br/><br/>Our envoy team will be entirely out of contact once they have passed through the wormhole. Our only recourse will be to wait and see.<br/><br/>Should the Hydras reject our offer of negotiations once again, we have one final recourse. The second security officer accompanying the envoy team will be carrying a specially designed case containing an antimatter bomb with an estimated yield of 0.75 megatons. All of the human members of our envoy team have been briefed on how to operate the device. They understand what they are committing to. One way or another, no further invaders will be coming through the wormhole.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.CooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target the alien wormhole module at their primary Kuiper Belt base with the {winnerOrgMission} mission
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.CooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=The period after our envoy team passed through the wormhole felt like an age.<br/><br/>Our forces withdrew and waited in a tense standoff with the remaining Hydras. Minutes passed, then hours. We waited, studying our sensors for any indication of the burst of radiation that would have indicated that the bomb on the other side of the wormhole had detonated.<br/><br/>Yet what eventually came through the wormhole was two of our own personnel. They brought incredible news. The Hydra leadership had agreed to a temporary ceasefire.<br/><br/>From there, things moved swiftly. More Hydras passed through the wormhole, armed and suspicious but not immediately hostile. They demanded access to our bioweapon. We refused, but stressed that we would not use it so long as the ceasefire was maintained. The Hydras declared that this was unsatisfactory, but – crucially – this time they did not cut off communications. Instead, we have been able to set up a relay system allowing for back-and-forth message transmission with the Hydra leadership on the other side of the wormhole.<br/><br/>Relations are still tense. The Hydras continue to make demands, and back on Earth, the anti-alien factions are refusing to commit to the ceasefire. But negotiations continue, and already the Hydra demands are becoming almost reasonable. They have dropped their insistence on the orbital weapons platforms and instead are demanding guarantees against bioweapon research and development. We have agreed in principle, in exchange for the Hydras recognizing human sovereignty over Earth, and we will offer access to our existing bioweapons research at some point in the future as a further incentive. They are asking for volunteers to join their forces, as well. Arguments continue – but they are the kind of arguments I am well familiar with in diplomatic exchange, the kind where both sides have a stake in the outcome. Hard as it may be to believe, I think this ceasefire will last. And once a ceasefire is in place, it is much, much easier to maintain it than it is to establish it in the first place.<br/><br/>Our position is still precarious. The anti-alien factions on Earth have already made it clear that they consider this truce only a temporary break in hostilities while they build up their strength. It is only a matter of time until they launch an attack upon the Hydras – or us. And the Hydras still do not have the slightest faith or trust in our species. If they can see a way to subjugate us without risk, I have no doubt that they will take it. Yet compared to a month ago, our situation has improved immeasurably. For the first time, there is a visible path, no matter how shaky, towards peace.<br/><br/>In the early weeks after first contact, I had a dream that one day, humans and our alien visitors might be united – an alliance of alien species, each different, each cooperating. We are far, far from the day where that could ever come, if it is even possible at all.<br/><br/>But what we have done here is a good start.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.CooperateVictory.CooperateCouncil=Against all odds, we have done it, Chancellor. The Hydra are speaking to us as equals. Perhaps, someday, we will speak together as partners.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.AppeaseCouncil=Investigate Alien Crash
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.AppeaseCouncil=The alien spacecraft has crashed in a remote region of our planet, and from what we have learned, everyone is on their way there. Agents from many organizations are converging on the crash site. We must get there first and prevent anyone from starting a war.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.AppeaseCouncil=Have a councilor conduct the Investigate Alien Activity mission at the crash site.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.AppeaseCouncil=We arrived too late to contact the aliens, but thankfully, so did everyone else. From what we can tell, the alien crew departed the crashed ship and disappeared into the surrounding wilderness before any of the soldiers hunting them could find them. All in all, it is very good news.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we must continue to build our numbers. Other factions are using the same old-fashioned discriminatory hiring practices. We will be different: more open, more inclusive, sensitive to the needs of the marginalized. Our faction will be something revolutionary, open to all.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.AppeaseCouncil=The race to meet an alien is underway, Commissioner. We have had a good start.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirSignatures.AppeaseCouncil=Research Alien Signatures
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirSignatures.AppeaseCouncil=Control over the alien crash site is being disputed by various local and international factions. While most seem to be focused on securing the ship, more important is the ship's crew. Ideally we would find some way to communicate with them, but for now, our priority is their safety.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirSignatures.AppeaseCouncil=When it becomes available, complete the "Alien Signatures" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirSignatures.AppeaseCouncil=We have done our part to eliminate any tracks or traces of the alien crew, and for now, it appears that we have been successful. The aliens have disappeared without trace and it appears that the profiteers and extremists are busy fighting over the scraps of the spacecraft. We can justly be proud of our efforts.<br/><br/>New recruits are flooding into our fledgling organization, and our base of operations is alive with optimism and new ideas. Many have plans and ideas for what the alien arrival could mean. There is a sense of blooming potential, all very exciting! I am sure this can only lead to positive things. It feels as though we are witnessing the beginnings of a cultural revolution.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirSignatures.AppeaseCouncil=Commissioner, we can only hope that first contact is upon us.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOrigin.AppeaseCouncil=Research Alien Origin
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOrigin.AppeaseCouncil=Information filtering out from the crash site seems to suggest that much of the alien ship was manufactured, not on some distant star, but here in our Solar System. Perhaps the aliens did not travel here directly, but have some local base of operations? If so, could we perhaps contact them there?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOrigin.AppeaseCouncil=Research the Skywatch and Deep System Skywatch global technologies, and then the Alien Origin project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOrigin.AppeaseCouncil=We now have a much clearer picture of the alien movements. At some point relatively recently, they constructed a base in the outer regions of our Solar System and used it to build the ship that crashed on Earth. This is good news! Constructing a base implies some level of long-term commitment. If they intend to reside in our Solar System for a long period of time, they may be more inclined to a peaceful solution.<br/><br/>I must admit, the thought of how advanced the aliens must be is an exciting one. The level of technology to travel between the stars, the kind of social advancement to build a society that can function harmoniously enough to reach this point ... their accomplishments clearly dwarf our own. If only we can persuade them to share their knowledge with us!
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOrigin.AppeaseCouncil=Our investigation into the aliens' origin is complete, Commissioner.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienAbductions.AppeaseCouncil=Investigate Alien Abductions
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienAbductions.AppeaseCouncil=There is disturbing news. We have received reports of missing animals and human beings in the regions near to the crash site. Already the more xenophobic voices in the media are blaming the aliens.<br/><br/>It is essential that we investigate this as soon as possible. If this is some kind of propaganda operation designed to harm human-alien relations, we must uncover it as soon as possible. We cannot allow a handful of loud-mouthed bigots to sabotage our future. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.AppeaseCouncil=Conduct Surveil Location missions in regions near any alien crash sites. If abductions are detected, send a councilor on an Investigate Alien Activity mission at that location.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.AppeaseCouncil=We have investigated the disappearances. At first we suspected the incidents of being manufactured, but after some cross-checking it does appear that a certain number of creatures of various species, as well as several humans, have gone missing as reported. However, we have found no proof of any kind that the aliens are responsible.<br/><br/>Given how tense and potentially explosive our current situation, we feel it would be grossly irresponsible to encourage anyone to believe the conspiracy theories currently being peddled by groups such as the so-called "Resistance." As such, our official position is that these disappearances are the work of anti-alien extremists seeking to drive a wedge between us and our alien visitors. It makes no sense, after all – why would aliens cross the vastness of outer space just to abduct some backwoods locals? It seems far more likely that the aliens are being used as a convenient scapegoat. All members of our organization will be issued directives accordingly. We must speak with one voice on this matter.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienAbductions.AppeaseCouncil=We must get to the bottom of these bizarre disappearances, Commissioner.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMethods.AppeaseCouncil=Research Alien Methods
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMethods.AppeaseCouncil=The disappearances are, unfortunately, continuing. Though we have already made it clear that these events are most likely the work of human agents, some members of our faction have been privately expressing unease. In light of this, the Council has decided to conduct a more thorough investigation, in the hope of settling the matter.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMethods.AppeaseCouncil=Research the "Alien Methods" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMethods.AppeaseCouncil=Our investigators have accumulated a great deal of data on the "abductions," first of animals and later of humans. We still have discovered no conclusive proof that implicates the aliens, and as such our official position remains that human extremists are the most likely culprits. However, enough rumors of alien involvement have surfaced that convincing people of this may be difficult. In times such as this, people are fearful, and can be easily swayed by demagogues. We will do what we can to present a more factual, sensible view, but the challenge may be a difficult one.<br/><br/>The eagerness with which some people will believe messages of hate is depressing. One would have thought that humanity's past would have taught them better, but then, those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMethods.AppeaseCouncil=We are still receiving mixed information from our field investigators, Commissioner.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateEnthrallMission.AppeaseCouncil=Investigate Returned Abductees
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateEnthrallMission.AppeaseCouncil=We have uncovered evidence that some of the "abducted" humans have resurfaced. This could be an opportunity to prove to the world that cooperation with the aliens is the best course of action. We should investigate immediately.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.AppeaseCouncil=Perform Surveil Location missions in areas with a suspected alien presence. Send councilors on Investigate Alien Activity missions when you discover evidence of alien influence on the populace or leaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.AppeaseCouncil=Events have gone ... somewhat badly.<br/><br/>Our agents tracked one of the returned "abductees" and uncovered evidence that they were engaged in some kind of espionage activity with links to the aliens. We hoped to continue to monitor them from a safe distance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, our operation was interrupted by anti-alien extremists who made wild claims implicating the abductee in some sort of kidnapping plot. They attempted to arrest the abductee, our agents attempted to protect the abductee, and unfortunately, despite our attempts to negotiate a peaceful solution, violence broke out. Several people were killed in the ensuing firefight.<br/><br/>The abductee managed to escape in the confusion, but apparently, from what we have been able to gather, traveled straight from the firefight to the residence of a local government official, and proceeded to kidnap her. This behavior is totally out of character for the abductee, who according to all that we have gathered has no history of violence or political extremism.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, accounts of the event have spread rapidly. Anti-alien media sources are already attempting to paint us as "collaborators." Our allies are providing a more balanced picture, but anti-alien sentiments are on the rise across the world. We may soon be a lone voice of truth in an ocean of misinformation.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateEnthrallMission.AppeaseCouncil=Commissioner, we are finding humans working on behalf of the aliens in some capacity. We must investigate further.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOperations.AppeaseCouncil=Research Alien Operations
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOperations.AppeaseCouncil=In the aftermath of the recent unfortunate incident with the abductee, further reports have surfaced. It appears that other events, bearing some similarity to the one we were involved in, are taking place with increasing frequency, and it does appear that the aliens may be at least tangentially involved. Public opinion towards the aliens is rapidly turning hostile. We must discover the truth as quickly as possible: If these cynical actors are able to shape the discourse, the result will be disastrous.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOperations.AppeaseCouncil=Research the "Alien Operations" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.AppeaseCouncil=As days go by, evidence mounts that a shift in our world's climate of opinion is taking place. Countries that were previously anti-alien are rapidly swinging towards more moderate, peace-oriented political stances, driven by key individuals in certain regimes suddenly moderating their views or being replaced by less aggressive voices. Much as I would like to credit this to humanity collectively finding their senses, I fear that the conversions may have been less than voluntary.<br/><br/>The mood among our people is uneasy. While we of course welcome the removal of so many extreme or hateful views, this plays into the hands of those claiming that the aliens wish to dominate or control us. Many of those who were previously devoted to the peace movement are now noticeably more subdued.<br/><br/>Still, it is difficult to argue with results. The countries that have been "pacified" by this unknown means may not have done so voluntarily, but one must admit that their change has been for the better. <h>We have also activated an alien activity monitor. It is viewable in the alien tab of the intel screen.</h>
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOperations.AppeaseCouncil=Perhaps this is an opportunity to press for peace, Commissioner?

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMovements.AppeaseCouncil=Research Alien Movements
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMovements.AppeaseCouncil=With the conflict between pro-war and pro-peace factions intensifying, it is more essential than ever that we open up negotiations with the aliens. Unfortunately, they have so far failed to respond to any of our requests for contact. A more focused search is needed. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMovements.AppeaseCouncil=Research the "Alien Movements" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMovements.AppeaseCouncil=We have, after many setbacks, succeeded in making contact with a network of human representatives who credibly claim to be able to place us in contact with our alien visitors. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many are returned abductees, but now is not the time to dwell on such matters. If all goes well, we will shortly have our historic first diplomatic contact.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of nervousness among our personnel. Rumours are swirling that the aliens possess some kind of mind control that they employ upon any humans that come near them. I have personally assured our diplomatic team that they have nothing to fear and that no harm will come to them, but still, morale is shaky.<br/><br/>The situation is extremely tense. I pray that these talks will go well. We desperately need a diplomatic success, not only for our sake, but for that of the entire world.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMovements.AppeaseCouncil=Commissioner, this is the breakthrough we need to make our first contact.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ContactTheAliens.AppeaseCouncil=Contact the Aliens
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ContactTheAliens.AppeaseCouncil=The time has come to open up diplomatic relations with our alien visitors. We have assembled a full delegation of diplomats, speakers, and negotiators with backgrounds in conflict resolution. The members of our delegation have been preparing their presentation, with an emphasis on our desire for a peaceful settlement and the benefits our faction could bring. We must show the aliens that not all humans are like Humanity First.<br/><br/>Our most recent message indicates that the aliens are willing to speak to us. All that remains is to open contact.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ContactTheAliens.AppeaseCouncil=Locate an alien operative on Earth and use one of our councilors to conduct a Contact mission on it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ContactTheAliens.AppeaseCouncil=We are still piecing together what happened.<br/><br/>All accounts agree that our delegation arrived at the meeting point and secured the area without incident. The alien representatives then appeared and our delegation began their presentation ... and that was when everything went wrong.<br/><br/>It seems that some of the more fanciful rumors about our alien visitors were not fabrications. Their ability to exercise influence over nearby humans is more extensive than we expected, and apparently, when they met with our delegation, they proceeded to do so. Some members of our delegation reacted ... very badly. Many attempted to flee or break off the negotiations. We're not sure who fired first. The casualty list is appalling. Some of these are people who were with us from the very beginning. They were good people, devoted to the cause of peace. How could this have happened?<br/><br/>There is one small shred of good news from this catastrophe. The aliens seem unconcerned by these events; they have given us teaching devices designed to help us to understand their language, and are willing to establish full diplomatic relations once we succeed. The tone of their messages almost implies that they view our casualties as an irrelevance, though that must surely be a miscommunication.<br/><br/>But in the meantime, the worst is yet to come. Some of the members of our delegation who fled the meeting have not returned. If they release an account (or worse, recordings) of the events at the meeting, it will be a public relations catastrophe. Our enemies will pounce on the story and will claim that it proves they were right all along. The Council has unanimously voted to find our missing members and bring them home.<br/><br/>I pray that they will come voluntarily.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ContactTheAliens.AppeaseCouncil=Commissioner, our first attempt at contacting the Aliens did not go smoothly, but we have obtained a device that will teach us their language.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAlienTechnology.AppeaseCouncil=Research Alien Technology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAlienTechnology.AppeaseCouncil=In addition to their language teaching devices, the aliens have granted us several items referred to as technology subpersona cores. Their role is to teach us the secrets of the aliens' technology ... or at least those parts of it that the aliens are willing to share. Clean energy, climate adjustment, environmental repair, medical research ... there are so many advances that could transform life here on Earth. If the aliens will only teach us their secrets, then, unpleasant as it may sound, the lives we have lost will be more than worth it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAlienTechnology.AppeaseCouncil=Research the "Alien Technology" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAlienTechnology.AppeaseCouncil=We have finished studying the alien subpersona cores. The contents are ... not what I had hoped. The cores are not designed to teach us about climate science, or medicine, or the environment. Instead, they are focused exclusively upon military engineering and space-to-ground weapons. Perhaps there has been some sort of mistake?<br/><br/>A recording has surfaced of our disastrous first contact. It claims that several members of our delegation broke and fled, and that the aliens gave the order to have them shot down. The Council has agreed that this must be a forgery, designed to sow discord among those factions advocating for peace. All copies of the recording are to be deleted from our internal networks.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchAlienTechnology.AppeaseCouncil=Commissioner, I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation for this, but I'm not sure what it is.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.AppeaseCouncil=Learn Their Language
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.AppeaseCouncil=The alien language teaching devices are extremely advanced. We should be able to bring a core group of our members to fluency in a remarkably short space of time, though fully speaking the Hydra language will unfortunately be beyond human capabilities.<br/><br/>We have also tracked down the deserters from our abortive first contact. The debate among the Council has been bitter, but in the end a majority of our members have agreed that they must not be allowed to disseminate their story. The stakes are simply too high. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.AppeaseCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.AppeaseCouncil=The language teaching program is complete.<br/><br/>Our security teams found the deserters. They did not come willingly. There was a fight. I don't know the details. It shouldn't have had to come to this.<br/><br/>Our head of security, Lavrentiy, suggested that I did not need to review the footage. I watched it anyway. It is hard to see how the shooting started. There was one exchange with one of our diplomats – I remember him, very passionate. He keeps on saying over and over again that I'd promised that no harm would come to them. The footage cuts out abruptly.<br/><br/>I shouldn't have watched those videos.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.AppeaseCouncil=The only direction to go is forward, Commissioner.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ConductHydraDiplomacy.AppeaseCouncil=Conduct Diplomacy with the Aliens
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConductHydraDiplomacy.AppeaseCouncil=Now that we have a body of negotiators fluent in the Hydra language, we can open up negotiations in a more systematic manner. We have learned from our past mistakes – all of our negotiation team have been carefully screened. Head of Security Lavrentiy has interviewed them individually and he has personally assured me that no similar event will happen again.<br/><br/>We have resolved to move on from the previous tragedy. While regrettable, these kinds of miscommunications and translation errors are an unfortunate reality of contact between such disparate cultures. What is important now is to make sure that the lives lost were not spent in vain. Everyone must devote themselves whole-heartedly to our cause. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConductHydraDiplomacy.AppeaseCouncil=Complete the "Hydra Diplomacy" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraDiplomacy.AppeaseCouncil=Success! We have established a long-term, two-way diplomatic channel with the Hydra representatives. From now on, we will be able to exchange messages with them on a near-real-time basis. The Hydras are so far not entirely responsive to our efforts to conduct negotiations or build rapport, but I have every reason to expect that this will improve with time. Once a peace process has begun, human history shows us that there is every reason for optimism. The Hydras have indicated that they will be transmitting a set of diplomatic requests shortly, which I consider a very good sign.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, on this matter, the advisory team is less unified than I had hoped. Lavrentiy has brought evidence to me suggesting that several members are considering abandoning the peace process. I cannot believe that any committed members of our faction would follow such a self-destructive course of action, but then, I have been disappointed in the past. Hopefully they will be cleared of suspicion in time.

TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchExotics.AppeaseCouncil=Research the "Exotic Materials" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchExotics.AppeaseCouncil=The alien Exotics are indeed reflective of an understanding of materials science far beyond ours. We can understand what they do, and theorize how they were made, but those theories imply production processes with the capacity for heat, cold and pressures far beyond anything we can construct. Perhaps in a few centuries ... <br/><br/>Until then our understanding is sufficient that we can reshape our stockpiles of exotics to employ in our own construction projects. With no means of producing them, however, we will have to obtain our supplies from the aliens themselves.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirDemands.AppeaseCouncil=We have received the Hydra requests. It appears, however, that "requests" may have been an inaccurate translation. From a first inspection, they seem more akin to orders. We have attempted to negotiate but have so far received no response.<br/><br/>Clearly, for now at least, we have no option but to begin to move ahead with the Hydra requirements, but there is some discord amongst the Council. I shall address them personally to explain to them the necessity for our actions. We have come too far to stop now.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirDemands.AppeaseCouncil=Complete the "Research Their Demands" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirDemands.AppeaseCouncil=The Hydra demands are as follows.<br/><br/>1. Humanity is to cease all military operations against Hydra forces and place all their forces under the command of Hydra-appointed representatives.<br/>2. Humanity is to commit to building no space fleet, weapons of mass destruction, or any other military assets that could present a threat to the Hydra race. Any such weapons in existence must be turned over to Hydra-appointed representatives.<br/>3. Humans will commit to supporting the Hydra race in any and all future endeavors or military conflicts. A standing human force will be raised and trained to serve under Hydra handlers in future operations, first with volunteers and then with conscripts if the aliens require it.<br/>4. To ensure that points 2. and 3. are carried out, orbital weapons platforms will be placed in low Earth orbit carrying sufficient firepower to suppress any possible human resistance. These weapons platforms will be placed under the control of Hydra-appointed representatives.<br/><br/>The debate in the Council was impassioned. Many spoke against the alien conditions. The demand for a standing military force raised the most outrage; many insisted that our faction's purpose was peace, not war. In the end I was forced to cut off the debate and issue an executive order accepting the Hydra demands. The situation is sensitive, and the time for discussion is over.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it appears that Lavrentiy's warnings were accurate. Certain members of the advisory team attempted to reverse my decision after the meeting was over. They have been placed under arrest for the time being, for their and our protection. I cannot help but feel frustration. Can they truly not see the necessity of our actions? At stake is not merely the success of our movement, but the very survival of humanity itself.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirDemands.AppeaseCouncil=Commissioner, the aliens are so powerful. We have no alternative if we hope to preserve the human race. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchAppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=Set Our Goals
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchAppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=Now that we have some understanding of the plan the aliens are following, we must adjust our own objectives. This need not be done immediately; contacting the aliens and establishing a dialogue remains our priority. However, at some point we must face the question: once we have reached an agreement with the aliens, how are we to make the rest of the world accept it?
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchAppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=Complete the "Appease the Invaders" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchAppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=This problem has been a difficult one. Some members of the Council have approached the question from an idealistic standpoint, focusing on human rights, while others have taken a more realist stance.<br/><br/>In the end we keep coming back to the same problem; how to deal with the anti-alien factions? It is the paradox of tolerance; no matter how virtuous and understanding we try to be, it is all for nothing while others choose to pursue violence. They are clearly impossible to reason or coexist with.<br/><br/>Our current thinking aims to attack the problem from two directions. Firstly, we will place an emphasis on party unity and shoulder-to-shoulder agreement. We and all of our allies must speak with a single voice. Then we can present the outcome of our negotiations with the aliens in such a way that the majority of listeners will be satisfied. Secondly, we will pursue whatever actions are necessary to suppress the more extremist and anti-alien factions, and in this area, I am afraid, we shall have to resort to military force. The clear superiority of the alien technology should add to the weight of our arguments in this regard. For those who see the manifest truth of alien supremacy, and still choose to resist ... well. They won't be missed.<br/><br/>A difficult task lies ahead of us, but still, despite everything, I am hopeful. At the end of the day, despite all the compromises, we have one great advantage over those who seek war with the aliens: We are better people than they are. History is on our side; those who attempt to deny progress may seem strong in the moment, but they always lose in the end.

A great deal of work must be done to prepare the Sentinel modules. After that, we will have to establish the standing force that the Hydras have demanded, but they have indicated that the Sentinels are their priority.<br/><br/>Already various members of our faction have contacted me to make protests. After the fifth or sixth, I have stopped taking their calls. I am so tired of listening to their complaints. Do they think we're doing this because we like it? There is absolutely no other choice! Lavrentiy has suggested that the protestors be pre-emptively removed from sensitive positions, and I have agreed, at least for now. Once peace has been established, and people have come to see the necessity of our actions, we can return to a more normal state of operations. For now, security is paramount.

TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchCoexistencePact.AppeaseCouncil=Plans for the Sentinels are ready. The blueprints and locations for each orbital weapon have been finalized. All that remains is to build them.<br/><br/>There was a terrorist attack upon our research facility. The perpetrators attempted to destroy our Sentinel designs, but Lavrentiy had anticipated the attack and doubled the guard. At first we naturally assumed that other factions were responsible, but upon further investigation it appears that the terrorist group had its roots within our own organization. Calls to action were posted on our internal communications network. The messages have since been deleted, and all of the surviving perpetrators and their suspected co-conspirators placed under arrest for interrogation.<br/><br/>I am sick of these constant acts of sabotage. An internal state of emergency has been declared. All of our members who have shown insufficient enthusiasm or a lack of commitment to our cause are to be placed in protective custody for the duration of the crisis. Already scores have been removed from their positions. Some people have claimed that we do not have enough holding facilities for so many, but Lavrentiy has assured me that he will take care of the problem, and in any case I do not have time for irrelevant details. I am busy saving the human race.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConstructSentinelModules.AppeaseCouncil=We are very close. The Sentinels are ready for construction. Ten modules should be sufficient to provide full coverage of the planet.<br/><br/>We can expect heavy opposition. Terrorist and militants will undoubtably attempt to sabotage the project. There is no more room for hesitation or half measures. I have issued orders that any saboteurs, and anyone who attempts to aid them, will be subject to summary execution.<br/><br/>This is a battle for the future of our planet. Build the Sentinels. Save our world. Eliminate all who stand in our way.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConstructSentinelModules.AppeaseCouncil=Build 10 Sentinel Complex hab modules on stations in Low Earth Orbit.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConstructSentinelModules.AppeaseCouncil=The amount of opposition we have met has been maddening. Sabotage and space attacks and attacks on our supply chain and personnel, over and over again, every single day. It feels as though everyone on Earth has turned against us. It makes me want to scream. Why do they keep fighting us? This is for their own good! Don't they see how much we've sacrificed for them?<br/><br/>Another member of the advisory team was discovered to possess restricted data about our security arrangements without proper authorization. I have dissolved the remains of the team and taken on sole decision-making authority for the present. None of them can be relied upon. Lavrentiy is the only remaining member of our command staff whom I trust. And you, of course.<br/><br/>In any case, it is done. The Sentinels are built. With the press of a button, we can devastate any population center on Earth. Surely now our enemies will see the futility of resisting ... but then, they haven't shown any trace of rationality in the past, have they? Perhaps it would be best if we did activate one of the Sentinels as a demonstration. This whole senseless war has made it clear that there are some parts of humanity that Earth will be better off without. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ConstructSentinelModules.AppeaseCouncil=The Sentinels are ready for activation, Commissioner. The final peace is at hand.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.AppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=Pacify the Earth
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.AppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=The war is over. We've won! Why do they keep resisting?<br/><br/>It's always like this. No one listens to the peaceful ones, those who try to talk and understand and find a solution. All they respect is the threat of violence. Well, that is what we're bringing to them now. Maybe once it's all over they'll wish they'd listened.<br/><br/>I don't trust Lavrentiy. I asked to talk with one of the members of the Council. He said she was unavailable. How can she be unavailable? That's the whole point of putting someone under arrest, isn't it? They're supposed to be there when you want them! Where has everybody gone, anyway?<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout. You have done ... very well. You've carried out everything I've asked. Even when it's been difficult.<br/><br/>I'm not feeling very well.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.AppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target one of our Sentinel modules with the {winnerOrgMission} mission.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.AppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=Ah, Commissioner. As you can see, our security chief, Lavrentiy, is accompanying me this time. Shut the door, please. We have a great deal to talk about.<br/><br/>You might have noticed a slight disturbance? I see, you were studying the disposition of our space forces. Very understandable. Well, twenty minutes ago our Sentinel Modules were brought online. Lavrentiy had given orders that the system be employed in such a way as to provide a demonstration to the world at large. Unfortunately, it seems there was a malfunction in the targeting systems, and the demonstration did not entirely occur in the North Atlantic Ocean as we had anticipated. As such, Sentinel Module Eight fired upon New York City, where the remaining members of our advisory team were meeting with representatives of the United Nations. Rescue efforts are ongoing, but regrettably, it appears that there are no survivors.<br/><br/>No, I mean there are no survivors on the southern half of Manhattan Island.<br/><br/>A great tragedy, yes. Very unfortunate. We have fixed the malfunction in Eight, but some members of our faction are quite distraught. Our advisory team had great support within our ranks ... well, perhaps a little less so, of late. I am afraid the stress of their position may have been affecting their judgment. Some of their most recent communications were a little erratic. Idealists are perhaps not so well suited to the day-to-day tasks of managing a mature organization. Revolutions are all well and good, but once they are completed, one needs a steady hand at the reins.<br/><br/>In any case, there is some good news to come out of the whole unfortunate affair in New York – it has quite silenced any organized resistance against our forces. Public opinion is still rather negative, but once we extend our control of global media, everything should fall into place. We already have our first public relations campaign ready to launch, one that emphasizes the health and economic benefits that Protectorate authority will bring. We've taken some footage of doctors healing sick children under Hydra supervision, that sort of thing. It's quite touching.<br/><br/>After all your hard work, you really do deserve a rest, but I'm afraid there's still more to do. The Hydras have given orders that they will require us to supply two million soldier candidates within the next two months, with another eight million to follow in the six months after that. They won't actually be sending that many off-planet, but apparently their requirements for their elite servants are strict, and rather a lot of candidates are discarded. In any case, we have plenty of people here on Earth who until recently were opposing us. I don't imagine it'll be difficult to find people whom we can do without.<br/><br/>Ten million might seem like a lot, but after all, if there's one thing Earth isn't short of, it's humans. Given global birth rates, ten or twenty million a year is quite easy to make up for. And once you take into account the problems we've been having with overpopulation, it might even be a blessing in disguise. I expect that within a few years, people will grow quite accustomed to this new arrangement.<br/><br/>Well, I am going to leave your service now and return to my family in India. I'm very tired. Lavrentiy will take over my duties. Congratulations on everything you've accomplished. We couldn't have done it without you.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.AppeaseVictory.AppeaseCouncil=It's over, Commissioner. We have made them listen to reason.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.SubmitCouncil=Journey To Their Arrival!
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.SubmitCouncil=From the highest to the lowest, the arrival caught everyone by surprise. I was no exception. It was only after some time that I came to understand what I should have seen immediately. This was no accident.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.SubmitCouncil=Have a councilor conduct the Investigate Alien Activity mission at the crash site.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.SubmitCouncil=Unfortunately, the emissaries were long gone by the time our councilor arrived. We must be cautious; others are active in the area and will certainly seek to track the emissaries for purposes of their own. We cannot afford to lead them to their goal.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienCrashdown.SubmitCouncil=Superior, we did not locate the emissaries, but we collected a great deal of information at the crash site.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirSignatures.SubmitCouncil=Study Their Signs
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirSignatures.SubmitCouncil=Have you wondered why that spacecraft crashed as it did? Oh, I'm sure that the scientists and engineers poring over that wreck will come up with some mechanical explanation. But don't you think it strange that another species, so much more advanced than us, so much more experienced, should suffer such an inexplicable accident? We learned the secrets of flight only in the twentieth century, yet our passenger aircraft are as close to perfectly safe as any method of transport can be. The emissaries are far more skilled in space than we are in the air, so what could have brought down one of their ships? 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirSignatures.SubmitCouncil=When it becomes available, complete the "Alien Signatures" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirSignatures.SubmitCouncil=We have confirmed that at least one of the emissaries survived the crash and escaped into the local wilderness. It has – so far – remained hidden from the various human forces hunting it.<br/><br/>We have also received reports that animals and humans have been reported missing in the surrounding area. Is this the work of the emissaries, or their pursuers?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirSignatures.SubmitCouncil=Do not be afraid, Superior. The emissaries are still with us.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateAlienAbductions.SubmitCouncil=Investigate Their First Contacts
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateAlienAbductions.SubmitCouncil=Many of our followers believe that I am all-knowing. This is not true, but I admit, I allow them to believe it – a certain amount of mystique can be useful. With you, though, I will be honest, and in all honesty, I do not know what the aliens are doing. But I do know why they are doing it.<br/><br/>The aliens did not come here because they hate us, as the more xenophobic among our species believe. Nor did they come in friendship, as the more naive ones do. They did not come for profit, or for power, or out of necessity.<br/><br/>They came here because they are lost. They do not understand this, as yet, and neither do the people of Earth. But they will. It is our task to help them see.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.SubmitCouncil=Conduct Surveil Location missions in regions near any alien crash sites. If abductions are detected, send a councilor on an Investigate Alien Activity mission at that location.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateAlienAbductions.SubmitCouncil=Discreet questioning has revealed a number of disappearances, some of animals, but most of humans. All evidence does seem to confirm that these disappearances are the work of the emissaries.<br/><br/>This is disconcerting, and I will not pretend it is good news. Perhaps things could have unfolded differently were we the ones to make first contact. Still, we must adapt. The aliens clearly have their reasons for doing what they do. For now, we must have faith.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateAlienAbductions.SubmitCouncil=Having faith does not mean to be rigid, Superior. It means to follow the flow.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMethods.SubmitCouncil=Study Their Methodology
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMethods.SubmitCouncil=The aliens are not so different from us. Yes, they are far greater than we are, at least in some respects. But to view them as fundamentally "other" is a mistake. Had our positions been reversed – a matter of perhaps only a few thousand years – then we would be the ones looking down upon their planet now, just as they look down upon ours. The true question is: Were that the case, would we be acting as they were? Would we be approaching them with open hands, in peace? Or would we be far more brutal than they could ever be? To this question I have no answers, but I suspect it would be the latter. We have the potential to be nobler than the emissaries, and also the potential to be far worse.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMethods.SubmitCouncil=Research the "Alien Methods" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMethods.SubmitCouncil=The disappearances began with animals, then moved onto humans. The early disappearances follow no pattern that we can discern, but over time, they became focused on the rich and the powerful.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems clear that those humans who disappeared did not do so by choice. It appears that the aliens are, for now, seeking control rather than understanding. This is discouraging, but not unexpected. We knew that the aliens were searching for something, but it is clear now that they do not understand what they are searching for. They are, for now, treating humanity as hostile, and it is easy to understand why. To them, there is no visible difference between a human who understands them and one who hates them. The temptation must be great to simply use their natural superiority to exercise direct control.<br/><br/>Still, we knew from the beginning that our task would not be easy. The choice of the emissaries to act as they have done means that many will die ... including, perhaps, us. But death in a worthy cause is not to be feared. The plants may die, so long as the garden survives.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMethods.SubmitCouncil=Superior, it is upon us to show our nobility to the emissaries.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.InvestigateEnthrallMission.SubmitCouncil=Speak with the Chosen
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.InvestigateEnthrallMission.SubmitCouncil=When a populace settles a new land, they work to change it, to mold it, using their technology and traditions. At the same time, however, the land, far more subtly, works to change its new owners. Sometimes the land bends to the colonists's will, but far more often what happens is a fusion, a symbiosis, where what evolves is something entirely new. The settlers are the masters of the land, yet they in turn are shaped by it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.SubmitCouncil=Perform Surveil Location missions in areas with a suspected alien presence. Send councilors on Investigate Alien Activity missions when you discover evidence of alien influence on the populace or leaders.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.InvestigateEnthrallMission.SubmitCouncil=We have, at last, been able to meet with some of the humans chosen by the emissaries. Contacting them has been difficult – many unfriendly eyes are upon them, and some have disappeared once again, perhaps for good. We have learned to be extremely cautious upon a first meeting, and only later, in a more secure location, to speak of more sensitive subjects.<br/><br/>The Chosen are of course careful not to give away their emissaries' secrets. They listen, but do not speak. Earning their trust, and convincing to place us in contact with the emissaries, will be a long and slow process. But hard as it is, it will be a mere dress rehearsal for the task that lies ahead.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.InvestigateEnthrallMission.SubmitCouncil=Patience led us to the Chosen, Superior. Faith will guide us to the emissaries. 

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirOperations.SubmitCouncil=Learn the Alien Ways
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirOperations.SubmitCouncil=Control is the key.<br/><br/>The aliens believe that only through control can they find safety. How could they not? Whatever has damaged them so, it has left them drifting, purposeless, and so in their confusion they lash out. To them, it must seem that exercising dominance is their one refuge in a frightening and dangerous world.<br/><br/>But control can be an illusion. Once something obeys our direction, we come to use it, to depend upon it, until eventually all of our choices are shaped by what we persist in believing serves us. Tools are the subtlest traps of all, for they pull our attention outwards, away from ourselves. It is our own desires that are the most dangerous of masters. One who holds godlike power in his hands, yet who is unable to resist his baser impulses, is less free than the lowliest servant.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirOperations.SubmitCouncil=Research the "Alien Operations" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirOperations.SubmitCouncil=It is clear now that the emissaries have chosen the path of direct control, exercising their power over their Chosen directly. Nations are falling before them, as those in positions of influence fall one by one under their sway. Some among our species react with fear, others with anger. Peoples and countries are being torn apart as the Chosen and their enemies fight over the levers of power.<br/><br/>We still have little understanding of how the emissaries control their Chosen. The great danger is that their form of control is so overwhelming, so far superior to our capabilities, that it will leave their servants as nothing but mindless drones. Still, I do not believe this to be the case. The Chosen that we have encountered are still recognizably human – different, yes, but not entirely transformed. If the power they exercise is a matter of loyalty, of devotion ... then we may yet succeed.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirOperations.SubmitCouncil=Devotion and faith can lead us to true freedom, Superior.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirMovements.SubmitCouncil=Find the Alien Path
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirMovements.SubmitCouncil=We are drawing close to the point at which we must stand before the aliens with only our faith to guide us. I admit, it frightens me. Will I be proven worthy? To stand alone in a dark place, to know that no-one will ever learn what your fate might have been ... it is a hard thing to face. The temptation is great to delay, to make excuses, to search for some technological golden calf that promises safety. Yet that is the same trap the other factions have fallen into. They believe that their weapons and their research can protect them. But the only true path is to face our fears, and to surrender to them.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirMovements.SubmitCouncil=Research the "Alien Movements" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirMovements.SubmitCouncil=It has taken endless hours of slow, frustrating work. The Chosen were cautious; how could they be otherwise? We were hunted, forced to break contact, to start again, over and over from scratch. But at last we have succeeded. After so many requests, the emissaries have agreed to allow us into their presence. We will stand before them, and see them with our own eyes. And what will come then?
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirMovements.SubmitCouncil=We shall endeavor to pass every test, Superior, and stand before the Emissaries.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ContactTheAliens.SubmitCouncil=Contact the Aliens
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ContactTheAliens.SubmitCouncil=It is time to meet with the emissaries. Should I not return, it will fall to you to continue our work.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ContactTheAliens.SubmitCouncil=Locate an alien operative on Earth and send one of our councilors to conduct the Contact mission on it.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ContactTheAliens.SubmitCouncil=I have returned.<br/><br/>The experience was ... hard to describe. Being in their presence was very different to my visions. I gained no enlightenment, saw no great truth. What I felt instead was an overpowering sense of sympathy, of identification. I was constantly alert to the smallest movements and signals from the emissaries, and when they paused or deliberated I felt a terrible fear that I had offended or failed them in some way. When they gave an order, I jumped eagerly to obey. There was no hesitation, no questioning. It was the single-minded purpose of a trained soldier, or of a mother with her child.<br/><br/>Once I had left their presence, I withdrew to meditate. I could feel the urge to carry out their orders, to follow every direction, but another part of me understood that I needed to recenter myself. Gradually, as if from a dream, I awoke. The loyalty, the devotion ... all of those stayed. But I could think clearly again.<br/><br/>The reactions of the others who accompanied me are more varied. Some are still attempting to fulfill every last order they were given, no matter how trivial: once they have completed their instructions, they stare vacantly until prompted. Others, though, seem to retain more of their sense of self. I believe that the alien influence acts as a test, of sorts. Some have their minds overwhelmed with the desire to serve. But those who already loved the emissaries, who were already devoted to them, can retain their own identity, since for them, there is no conflict.<br/><br/>I would like to rest, but there is too much to do. First and foremost, we must come to learn the language of the emissaries, so that we may better serve.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ContactTheAliens.SubmitCouncil=With each test we grow closer to our goal, Superior.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirLanguage.SubmitCouncil=Learn Their Language
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirLanguage.SubmitCouncil=Meeting the emissaries has taken a great weight off my mind. I had been prepared to be a sacrifice; my great fear had been that the rest of our people would be sacrificed, too. Now that I know this will not happen, my fears are gone. All will be well.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirLanguage.SubmitCouncil=Conduct the "Hydra Language" research project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirLanguage.SubmitCouncil=Learning the language of the Hydras – for so the emissaries are called – has been an interesting process. The audible components are simple enough to come to recognize. Reproducing them, with the aid of mechanical devices, is also straightforward.<br/><br/>However, truly understanding their language requires us to stand in their presence. Their aura envelops us, providing emotion, connection, purpose. Without it, their language is a pale shadow of itself, limited and clumsy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems that we will never be able to share the emissaries's aura. We can understand their words, but we can never reproduce them. We will be children born without the gift of speech, forever spectators, never able to fully participate in their exchanges. It will be our curse, yet perhaps in it we may find insight. The vow of silence is an ancient one.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirLanguage.SubmitCouncil=Understanding precedes devotion, Superior.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ConductHydraDiplomacy.SubmitCouncil=Learn to Serve
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ConductHydraDiplomacy.SubmitCouncil=The power of speech is a great one, but now is the time to be cautious. So many human leaders have taken the power to communicate, to share thoughts and ideas, and used it for selfish purposes. We must approach the Hydras in humility, listening first and foremost and only speaking after much thought, if at all. Our purpose is to teach them, yet we must never forget that they are far wiser than we are.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ConductHydraDiplomacy.SubmitCouncil=Research the "Hydra Diplomacy" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ConductHydraDiplomacy.SubmitCouncil=We have now set up reliable communication channels with the emissaries. We will be able to speak with them on a regular basis going forward.<br/><br/>The emissaries have indicated that they have two tasks for us. The first involves establishing military control over Earth. The second is something far more ambitious: the creation of a new nation, something never seen before.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ConductHydraDiplomacy.SubmitCouncil=Unlike everyone else in this sick world, we listen, Superior. It may be our greatest strength.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheAlienNation.SubmitCouncil=Prepare the Alien Nation
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheAlienNation.SubmitCouncil=The place of the emissaries is to rule; ours is to serve. There is no shame in this: it is natural for the lesser to serve the greater. But the lesser can have lessons to teach, as well. We are a younger race than the Hydras, and it is our place to watch and to learn. Perhaps in time we will come to see what it is we can offer in return.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheAlienNation.SubmitCouncil=Research the "The Alien Nation" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheAlienNation.SubmitCouncil=The alien nation will be something altogether new. Through the emissaries' powers, much of the traps and dangers of human government can be avoided. There is no need for elaborate checks and balances to guard against the risk of officials abusing their power: the emissaries will ensure that the administrators of our new nation will carry out their duties faithfully. Crime and social disturbance can be dealt with without prisons or violence. The nation will be more stable, more peaceful, and more efficient than any in human history.<br/><br/>The heart of the alien nation will be the control facility. We now have its design and can begin its construction at any time. Once it has been completed, we can arrange for the emissaries to take up residence there, and transfer control of its higher-level functions to them ... though much of the administration will still fall to us. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheAlienNation.SubmitCouncil=A united humanity under alien guidance, Superior. So much potential for peace and growth, a new era for us all.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheirDemands.SubmitCouncil=Learn Their Purpose
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheirDemands.SubmitCouncil=For the longest time, one question has nagged at me. What happened to the emissaries? Something wounded them, wounded them so terribly that they have never recovered. But we have had no way to find out what it was. Until now.<br/><br/>Our meetings with the Hydras have begun to give me clues. Not in what they say, but in what is left unsaid. For all their power and wisdom, the emissaries are limited. Their mastery of inert matter is beyond equal; their ability to command and direct other creatures is equally impressive. But these are technical things. Where are their artists, their philosophers, their spiritual leaders? The obvious conclusion is that they are somewhere else, among the stars, but the more I listen, the less I feel that this is the answer. There is a void in the Hydras, an absence. Perhaps this is the hole we are meant to fill. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheirDemands.SubmitCouncil=Complete the "Their Demands" project when it becomes available. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheirDemands.SubmitCouncil=Now I begin to see.<br/><br/>The emissaries were not always as they are now. The great majority of their number were slain by a weapon that struck from space. Those that escaped were the soldiers, the engineers, the technicians. Their society survived, but damaged, incomplete. All of their efforts are now devoted towards ensuring that this can never happen again, and in doing so, they have abandoned their old path of leadership and guidance. They have lost their way.<br/><br/>The emissaries have given us instructions towards the building of orbital weapons systems. I feel that it is important for us to avoid this. While they would perhaps assist us against those other factions still active upon Earth, they would signal to the emissaries that we are like their other subjugated species, resentful slaves that serve only because they are forced to. We must help the emissaries step beyond raw dominance; show them that we serve out of love, not fear.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheirDemands.SubmitCouncil=We see the void within the Emissaries, Superior. We see now that our own purpose is to fill it. We will fulfill the destiny of both our species.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchSubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=Set Our Goal
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchSubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=It is hard to explain what I saw.<br/><br/>I did not hear the aliens, but I understood them. I did not recognise them, but I knew them, as one can know something learnt in childhood. They came to our world seeking, but they were fleeing as well; they are masters, yet they are also slaves. Fear is what drives them, fear of what befell them in the past, fear of what might happen again. They can be more, so much more, but they must move past their fear. Someone must teach them, help them, and we have an opportunity to be those teachers, those helpers.<br/><br/>Perhaps we shall fail. If we do, the consequences will be terrible. But I do not believe we will. I have faith in us, and in humanity. And in you.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchSubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=Complete the "Path to Paradise" project.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchSubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=The problem is control.<br/><br/>The emissaries do not trust us. This is regrettable, but understandable. We are a violent species – the aliens are, too, of course, in their own way, but anyone viewing the history of our planet would be inclined to evaluate us first and foremost as a threat. And what does one do with a threat? One controls it.<br/><br/>Simply speaking to the aliens, urging them to trust us, is of course not enough. The aliens would not believe us, and why should they? We must show them that we are worthy. The price may be high. Humans will die in the emissaries's service, perhaps in their thousands or millions. Yet it is the garden that matters, not the flower. Each death, each sacrifice, is an act of proof.<br/><br/>The emissaries have the potential to be something more, something greater than either of us could ever be alone. But hurt and lost as they are, they can only accept guidance from those they trust. It is our mission to earn that trust. Whatever it takes.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchSubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=Fear controls the emissaries, Superior. It demands they reach for control without thought. We can change that.

TIObjectiveTemplate.displayName.ResearchTheOneTruePath.SubmitCouncil=Research the One True Path
TIObjectiveTemplate.description.ResearchTheOneTruePath.SubmitCouncil=The seat of power is a lonely one. As more and more have flocked to our cause, my responsibilities have grown. It is no longer enough for me to be only a leader; I must be a figurehead, a symbol. You are one of the few with whom I can still talk freely.<br/><br/>So I – perhaps presumptuously – feel that I can understand what troubles the emissaries face. Though they are beyond our understanding, their problems may be the same. When one is alone, it is hard to trust. But trust is the only path by which they can escape what threatens them. We must teach them to have faith in us, as we have faith in them. 
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.ResearchTheOneTruePath.SubmitCouncil=Research the "The One True Path" project when it becomes available.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.ResearchTheOneTruePath.SubmitCouncil=The negotiations have been difficult. The Hydras are not accustomed to their servants expressing disagreement, even of the mildest kind, and I believe I was very close to being killed and discarded. Fortunately for me, there were some Hydras who offered a contrasting viewpoint, and I believe that it was only our military victories, and the loyalty we have displayed in our battles, that swayed them even this far. For this, as for many other things, I am in your debt.<br/><br/>In the end, after much discussion, the Hydras have agreed to offer us a chance. Should we prove beyond a doubt that the majority of our species is willing to serve them faithfully, they will agree to view us, at least on a trial basis, as servants and not as slaves.<br/><br/>To do this, we must be victorious both on land, and in space. The alien nation must grow to encompass a clear majority of the humans on Earth, and our fleet's power, in combination with our allies, must be clearly superior to all who might oppose it. If we can fulfil these conditions, the emissaries will waive their demands for the establishment of the orbital weapons systems.<br/><br/>This is the greatest challenge we have ever faced – and it is a challenge not just for us, but for all of humanity. Should we fail, we will become as the salamanders, or the griffins – slaves and shock troops, to be used as expendable pawns. But should we succeed, it will be the first step towards something more.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.ResearchTheOneTruePath.SubmitCouncil=Faith and love have prevailed, Superior, even in the face of fear and death.

TIObjectiveTemplate.description.SubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=It has been a long road.<br/><br/>Most humans – even most Hydras – did not believe. But we have done it. On land and in space, our numbers have swollen beyond counting. We are the Hydra of legend, ever-growing and legion.<br/><br/>Travel to the United Nations and bring them the joyful news. Proclaim the new order. Let all know that a new world has come.
TIObjectiveTemplate.solution.SubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=Have our councilor assigned the {winnerOrg} org target the New York region with the {winnerOrgMission} mission.
TIObjectiveTemplate.resolution.SubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=All is quiet.<br/><br/>The war rooms and briefing centers, that for so long have buzzed with plans and orders, are silent. There is still work to do, of course: resistance forces and terrorists will try to undermine what we have done. It is likely we will be assassinated in the coming years: it is the usual fate of prophets. But what we have done is greater than any of us. I would have laid down my life a hundred times for even the chance at success: what we have accomplished has been beyond our wildest dreams.<br/><br/>You see, I have seen what will come. The Hydras will continue to spread, their empire expanding through space. And wherever they go, we will be at their side, to protect and serve. More species will be added to our ranks, each bringing its own strengths, its own ways of understanding the universe. And as they join, some of them will come to share our purpose. We will become a hierarchy, a covenant. And some day, the Hydras will come to love their servants as we do them.<br/><br/>It will be a long journey, a long road, and neither of us will live to see its end. But what we have started today will transform the galaxy in the millennia to come.
TIObjectiveTemplate.quote.SubmitVictory.SubmitCouncil=Our faith has guided us into the light, Superior. The light of a new dawn.
