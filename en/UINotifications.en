UI.Notifications.TutorialDetail=Welcome to the tutorial for Terra Invicta. This is the beginning of a standard playthrough of the game at the difficulty you selected.<br/><br/>The tutorial has two primary components, which function independently of each other:<br/><br/>1. A set of objectives to guide you through key aspects of gameplay. Some of these objectives may take years to accomplish. Specific steps to take to accomplish these objectives appear at the top of the screen. These will appear alongside your regular campaign objectives that move the story along.<br/><br/>2. A description of various elements in the game's interface when you first open them. These will help you understand the various tools you have to complete your goals.<br/><br/>In addition, many of the game's mechanics are described in detail in the <h>Codex</h>, which can be opened by clicking the "?" box on many of the panels ingame. You may also reset the interface tutorial via the codex if you want to see it again.<br/><br/><h>The campaign starts just before the first Mission Phase. To start playing, either run the clock using the controls on the top-right corner of the screen or hit CONTINUE on all of these notifications.</h>
