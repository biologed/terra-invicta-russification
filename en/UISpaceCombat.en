UI.Precombat.BiddingHeader=Pursuit!
UI.Precombat.WereFleeing=Our fleet is maneuvering to avoid combat, but the enemy is giving chase. We may now bid some of our available Delta-V to try to outrun them. If we bid higher than they do, we avoid combat; if they bid more, we must fight them. The maximum bids are determined by the differences in the fleets' accelerations. Both sides will spend the lower of the two bids regardless of whether combat occurs.
UI.Precombat.WereChasing=The enemy fleet is maneuvering to avoid combat. We may now bid some of our available Delta-V to chase them. If we bid higher than they do, we will engage them; if they bid more, they escape. The maximum bids are determined by the differences in the fleets' accelerations.

UI.Precombat.PincerDetail=Split our fleet and encircle the enemy to prevent evasion. Enemy will engage the weaker of our two fleets.
UI.Precombat.ChaseMechanics=In a pursuit, the two fleets' relative accelerations determine how the chase will play out. If one fleet can significantly out-accelerate its opponent, it can force the engagement, or dodge it for little Delta-V. Two fleets with similar accelerations will engage in a slow stern chase, potentially spending a great deal of DV to resolve, if both sides commit to spending it.<br/><br/>The pursuit ends when the chasing fleet closes a distance of {0} times the maximum weapons targeting range of any ship in either fleet ({1}), or the evading fleet extends the distance between to the two fleets by the same amount.
UI.Precombat.ChaseMechanics_Fixed=In a pursuit, the two fleets' relative accelerations determine how the chase will play out. If one fleet can significantly out-accelerate its opponent, it can force the engagement, or dodge it for little Delta-V.
