UI.Tutorial.VO.1=Greetings Commander, I am Fiona Ayoade, your chief of staff. I'll be briefing you on the situation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.2=Our council is made up of some of the Earth's best and brightest. They are capable, connected and standing by for your orders.
UI.Tutorial.VO.3=If we truly face the threat of invasion, we need to start organizing now. We are going to need global cooperation on a never-before-seen scale. I recommend we start tasking our councilors with gaining support in strategic positions of power across the globe.
UI.Tutorial.VO.4=Reports are still coming in but it is clear that an alien object has crashed down on the planet. We should send a councilor to investigate the site as soon as possible.
UI.Tutorial.VO.5=This is your main command interface. From here we can monitor developments across the globe and beyond; send our councilors on missions; direct research and development; and much more. Take some time to familiarize yourself with it.
UI.Tutorial.VO.6=Information about our currently selected councilor appears in the bottom-right of the screen. Their available missions can be found in the bottom-center of the screen.
UI.Tutorial.VO.7=It will be critical for us to not lose sight of our goals. I will keep this screen updated with our current objectives.

UI.Tutorial.VO.9=Our researchers are asking for your guidance in directing their efforts.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10=This is the research screen. The top three charts show what the global scientific community is working on. The bottom charts show what council engineering projects we are privately pursuing. We can direct our researchers to prioritize any or all of these options.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10a=This is the Tech Tree. Our researchers have extrapolated out what different scientific breakthroughs could lead to.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10b= This is the Tech Tree. Our researchers have extrapolated out what different scientific breakthroughs could lead to. Frankly Commander, if I look at it too long I get a headache, and they say this is the simple one.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10c= And this, is the "complete" one…
UI.Tutorial.VO.10d=Commander, you have been staring at the tech tree for a while. How about a cup of coffee?
UI.Tutorial.VO.10e=This is the list of all the council engineering projects we can pursue at this time.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10f=These are the research archives where we can find reports on our completed research.
UI.Tutorial.VO.11=Our councilor has gained the support of people in key positions of power in a nation. We should consider what our priorities are for that nation.
