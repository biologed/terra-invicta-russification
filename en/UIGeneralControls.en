UI.GeneralControls.MoneySource=It is gained from national funding, the spoils priority, orgs, councilor traits, hab modules, and the sale of space resources on Earth.
UI.GeneralControls.InfluenceTip=We have {0} Influence.																	// value
UI.GeneralControls.InfluenceDetail=Influence represents political capital and the ability to sway institutions and people to pursuing your goals.
UI.GeneralControls.InfluenceSource=It is gained from favorable global public opinion about your faction's ideology, orgs, councilor traits, and hab modules. It is also spent on maintaining your control points each month.
UI.GeneralControls.OpsTip=We have {0} Ops available.																	// value
UI.GeneralControls.OpsDetail=Ops, or Operations, is our ability to conduct small-scale combat and espionage operations.
UI.GeneralControls.OpsSource=It is primarily gained from orgs, but also can come from councilor traits and certain hab modules in an Earth interface orbit.

UI.GeneralControls.BoostDetail=Each point of boost represents the capability to move ten metric tons of material from Earth's surface to Low Earth Orbit via rocket launches and other conveyances.<h> Boost can also deliver items to more distant destinations at a significant penalty and substitute for space resources.</h> 
UI.GeneralControls.BoostSource=It is primarily generated from nations with a space program, but also can come from orgs.
UI.GeneralControls.NoResearchIncomeTip=We are not generating any research.
UI.GeneralControls.ResearchIncomeTip=We are generating {0} research daily from the following sources:					// daily income
UI.GeneralControls.ResearchBonusesTip=We are receiving the following bonuses to these research categories:
UI.GeneralControls.ResearchBonusesListItem=  {0}: {1}
UI.GeneralControls.ResearchDetail=Research represents the efforts of our scientists and engineers. Unlike other resources, it is not accumulated but immediately distributed according to our research priorities, which are divided between global investigations into new principles and technologies and private engineering projects that only benefit our faction.
UI.GeneralControls.MissionControlTip=We have {0} Mission Control available. Our ships and habs require a total of {1} to operate at full effectiveness. Our Mission Control is provided by:
UI.GeneralControls.MissionControlDisruption=We are currently losing {0} of our Mission Control to disruption effects.
UI.GeneralControls.ManyMinesExtraCost=Our extensive network of space mines and catapults costs an extra {0} Mission Control to manage traffic between our habitats. Unless it is on a space body already hosting one of our mines, our next mine will cost an additional {1} Mission Control to add to the network.
UI.GeneralControls.MissionControlBreakdown=Our Mission Control requirements are:
UI.GeneralControls.ShipCostTip=  {0} for ships
UI.GeneralControls.HabCostTip=  {0} for habs
UI.GeneralControls.Monthly=Our monthly {1} income is {0}.
UI.GeneralControls.Annual=Our annual {1} income is {0}.
UI.GeneralControls.MissionControlDetail=The Mission Control resource accounts for all the staff and technical apparatus required to support our operations in space. Insufficient Mission Control makes it much easier for other factions to seize our space assets and makes accidents far more likely. We may not build or acquire new habs or ships if we do not have any mission control available. Excess mission control is converted to research and money.
UI.GeneralControls.EngineeringTipSingle={0} can conduct one engineering project at faction headquarters.
UI.GeneralControls.EngineeringTipMult={0} can conduct {1} simultaneous engineering projects. Their sources are:
UI.GeneralControls.EngineeringDetailNone=If we acquire orgs and hab modules that grant multiple engineering projects, we will complete projects much more quickly.
UI.GeneralControls.EngineeringDetail=Multiple engineering projects granted by councilor orgs and hab modules are increasing the speed we complete research projects by {0}.
UI.GeneralControls.SpaceResourcesTooltip=We have {0} units of {1} available for space construction and support projects. Our daily income from our habs is {2}. 	// value, resource, income
UI.GeneralControls.WaterDetail=Water is vital for life support and the production of hydrogen, which is used in propellant in many advanced space propulsion systems. It is rare in the inner Solar System but increasingly abundant beyond the Asteroid Belt. It is also a source of deuterium, which is used in nuclear applications. <h>Water will be sent from Earth when production is insufficient at a Boost penalty.</h>
UI.GeneralControls.VolatilesDetail=Volatiles are highly reactive substances like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, chlorine, phosphorous and many compounds that include hydrogen. These are critical for life support and self-sustaining space habitats. Carbon may also be fashioned into high-tech armors. <h>Volatiles will be sent from Earth when production is insufficient at a Boost penalty.</h>
UI.GeneralControls.BaseMetalsDetail=Base metals include common materials such as iron, nickel, lead, zinc, copper, aluminum and tin. They are important for construction. Alkali metals like lithium and metalloids like silicon and boron also fall in this category. <h>Base Metals will be sent from Earth when production is insufficient at a Boost penalty.</h>
UI.GeneralControls.NobleMetalsDetail=Noble metals include precious metals such as silver, gold, and platinum, as well as corrosion-resistant metals such as titanium and tungsten. They are used in construction and also may be sold on Earth for profit. <h>Noble Metals will be sent from Earth when production is insufficient at a Boost penalty.</h>
UI.GeneralControls.FissilesDetail=Fissiles include isotopes of uranium, thorium and (once processed) plutonium that are used to create nuclear fission reactions. These are used in nuclear propulsion systems and weapons. <h>Fissiles will be sent from Earth when production is insufficient at a Boost penalty.</h>
UI.GeneralControls.AntimatterDetail=Antimatter is composed of particles that annihilate when they strike normal matter, producing vast amounts of energy. Exceedingly difficult to create, capture and store, it is used in advanced propulsion systems and weapons.
UI.GeneralControls.ExoticsDetail=Exotics are a strange class of materials that exhibit properties that would seem to violate the known laws of physics. 
UI.GeneralControls.InsufficientSpaceResource=We are making up the shortfall by spending Boost to transport the materials from Earth.
UI.GeneralControls.InsufficientBoost=Our habs are operating in a limited capacity because of shortages in support materials. They will be much easier to capture by our enemies and may suffer critical failures at any time.
UI.GeneralControls.CPCapDetails1=We are currently managing control points with a value of {0} against our cap of {1}.
UI.GeneralControls.CPCapDetailsCost=<br/><br/>Being over the cap costs us {0}{1} per day, which is reflected in our nation influence income. Enemy missions targeting our control points will receive a bonus. We may abandon control points to reduce this cost or increase our cap through research or increasing our councilors' <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="attribute_administration"></color>Administration, <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="attribute_command"></color>Command, and <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="attribute_persuasion"></color>Persuasion attributes.
UI.GeneralControls.CPCapDetailsWarn=<br/><br/>Exceeding this cap will reduce our {0} income and make enemy missions targeting our control points much more likely to succeed. We may abandon control points to reduce this cost or increase our cap through research or increasing our councilors' <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="attribute_administration"></color>Administration, <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="attribute_command"></color>Command, and <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="attribute_persuasion"></color>Persuasion attributes.
