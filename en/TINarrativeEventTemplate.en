TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_OrbitalDebrisStrike.option0.outcome1.Detail=The damage caused by the strike was even worse than we feared! It appears that critical maintenance had gone unperformed at {targetHabName}, making the hab much less resilient to equipment failure than it should've been. Not only has this caused a great deal of damage to our hab and our crew, it has worsened the problem by introducing even more debris into {targetOrbitName}.

Following contingency plans drawn up by our tacticians, they quickly moved in to secure critical locations on board the hab: the core module, environmental controls, engineering, and communications. With these under our control, the crew's position became untenable, and they were soon forced to surrender.<br/><br/>While {targetHabName} sustained some damage in the fighting, it at least remains in our hands for now.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_HabRevolt.option2.outcome1.Detail=We ordered our on-site combat personnel in, but the rebels clearly anticipated our actions. As they moved in to secure critical locations, the Marines were ambushed in a blind junction and suffered heavy casualties; the survivors were taken prisoner and paraded in front of the cameras as evidence of {targetFactionName}'s perfidy.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_HabRevolt.option2.outcome2=Critical Failure.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_HabRevolt.option2.outcome2.Summary={actorNameWithArticleCap} accidentally destroyed {targetHabName} while attempting to suppress a revolt.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_HabRevolt.option2.outcome2.Detail=We ordered our on-site combat personnel in, but shortly after they engaged the rebels we suddenly lost all contact with {targetHabName}. Analysis of external footage and several erratic transmissions suggests that numerous critical components were damaged during the fighting, causing the entire hab to depressurize and slowly break apart. We are still attempting to recover survivors.<br/><br/>At least nobody else will get their hands on {targetHabName} now.

Upon our signal, they immediately went to work: neutralizing rebel ringleaders, sabotaging key equipment, and convincing crew members on the fence that they would be better off with us. Eventually, the revolt lost momentum and the crew elected to surrender.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_HabRevolt.option3.outcome1.Detail=We sent the signal to our long-term assets hidden amongst the crew of {targetHabName}, but hours later there was no indication of it being received or acted on. We can only surmise that our saboteurs were identified and eliminated before the revolt began, or perhaps they too decided to switch sides. Either way, we no longer control {targetHabName}.

The physiological effects of microgravity have an interesting way of levelling the field between newer and experienced players alike: the puffing out of cheeks, the spatial disorientation, and the amplification of small motions all serve to obfuscate existing tells and create new ones.

Perhaps they have simply had enough with invasive species arriving to ravage the local ecology.<br/><br/>Whatever the cause, the unanimity it has created is striking. Kangaroos and wallabies use flowering xenoflora stalks for boxing practice. Wombats burrow deep into the earth to root out the lattices of alien tendrils. Crocodiles have taken a liking to the taste of xenofauna, keeping the rivers clear; anything touched by a platypus's hind legs shrivels up and dies.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_DriftingDevice.option1.outcome0.Detail=After many intense weeks of frenetic preparation and careful maneuvering, our probe mission rendezvoused with the mysterious device and began to examine it.<br/><br/>What we found was surprising, even more so considering the current circumstances in our Solar System. The device's layout and composition does not correspond with what we previously observed of the aliens' technology; where the aliens' ships evince a kind of grace and beauty, this device is crude and menacing, designed for long-term survival in the vacuum of space over a duration of many years. In short: We don't think this is a product of our aliens, but of another species. This is both fascinating and concerning to our scientific and strategic planning staff.<br/><br/>On a technical level, our researchers were able to partially disassemble the device to study some of its components. They found what must be communications gear able to receive and transmit significant amounts of data, multiple telescopes, plus a powerful computer with our scientists say appears to be an array of math coprocessors. While the exact specifications are yet to be determined, the principles are compatible with our existing knowledge base and have already provided some useful insights into how we may upgrade our own systems.<br/><br/>We will continue to study the device, but for now the project is on the backburner.

The origin of the device is indeed not the Hydras, as our researchers observed, but actually the Salamanders, who played such a tumultuous role in their history.<br/><br/>The Hydra told us they found identical devices in their home system following the destruction of their homeworld following the Salamander attack. The device itself functions as an external observation and guidance system for the the Salamaders' interstellar Kinetic Kill Vehicle, a kind of robotic "forward air controller" sent ahead of the primary attack to provide final course correction data to the KKV.<br/><br/>We now know where the device came from and what its purpose was. The Salamanders had detected our civilization and were preparing to destroy it, just as they had done to the Hydra. We have no reason to disbelieve our Hydra captive's claims that their subjugation of the Salamander species is the only thing that prevented this; it described in detail the discovery of several KKVs under construction in the orbit of the Salamander homeworld, which the Hydra promptly disassembled.<br/><br/>The realization that humanity was facing extinction and the Hydra unintentionally saved us is unsettling, to say the least. Our Hydra captive seems to have detected our confusion, and our xenopsychologists are describing its response as both amused and vindicated.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_IoEruption.query=Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar system with over 400 active volcanoes, and our base here gives us an opportunity to study them in great detail. The cause of this extreme vulcanism is the tidal stress of being pulled between the gravity of Jupiter and the other Galilean moons, causing extreme heat through friction.<br/><br/>Extensive lava flows, some over 500 km in length, cover the surface of Io and the material ejected beyond the atmosphere produces a large plasma torus around Jupiter. Ions ejected from Io significantly shape Jupiter's magnetic field, resulting in it being more than twice the size it would otherwise be.

Concentrated around the subsolar point, the cause seems to be solar radiation penetrating the surface ice layer, heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure builds up for it to erupt through the crust. The combined effects of these geysers, over thousands of years, likely redistributes enough mass from the equator to the poles to cause polar wander.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_Cryovolcano.query=A cryovolcano is a type of volcano that erupts volatiles such as water, ammonia, or methane into an extremely cold environment that is at or below their freezing point. However, it has long been disputed if cryovolcanoes exist on Titan or if it is a geologically dead world where methane is not emitted by cryovolcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold interior. <br/><br/>Now that we have a permanent presence on Titan, a team of scientists from {targetHabName} have embarked on an extensive study of Sotra Patera, the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found. Spotted by the Cassini probe in 2010, it is one in a chain of at least three mountains, each between 1000 and 1500 meters in height, several of which are topped by large craters.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_MercuryPlasma.query=The atmosphere of Mercury has long been something of a mystery. The planet's low gravity should not be able to contain even an atmosphere this thin, and yet it does.

Unlike that of Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is not strong enough to deflect the solar wind, instead the magnetic fields twist together, grow, and a magnetic tornado is born. As gaps in the magnetic field open, solar plasma strikes directly on the planet's surface, throwing up atomic debris which is prevented from flying off entirely by Mercury's gravity.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_Marked_Combat_II.query=Exactly who placed the Mark on {targetCouncilorPersonalName} is still a mystery, but we have discovered that many of the assets hunting {targetCouncilorObjectivePronoun} are in communication with a heavily guarded warehouse from which someone appears to be coordinating their efforts. Taking out this coordinator will certainly disrupt their efforts.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_Marked_Combat_III=Marked: Last Chance
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_Marked_Combat_III.summary=The net is closing around {targetCouncilorFullName}.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_Marked_Combat_III.query=Time is running out. It is becoming increasingly difficult for {targetCouncilorPersonalName} to stay ahead of {targetCouncilorPossessivePronoun} hunters. And yet, it may be possible to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Made complacent by their progress, one of the hunters got sloppy and has openly visited a known crime lord. It is possible that this crime lord is either the placer of the Mark, or is a vital part of their organization, and that removing them will end the hunt. This is likely the last chance for {targetCouncilorPersonalName}.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_InformationLeak.query=The leaks reveal that {secondaryTargetNationName} has been spying on their close allies, a fact that many are aware of but do not want to acknowledge publicly. Worse still, these leaks reveal key details of their allies' military plans, supply levels, and other secrets. The leaks appear to have originated in an online chatroom of some kind.<br/><br/>Due to our influence over {secondaryTargetNationName}, this reflects poorly on {targetFactionName}. Some response will have to be made.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_EuropaPlumes=Europa's Plumes
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.summary=Periodically, vast plumes of water shoot out from Europa's polar region. They may be the key to discovering Europan life.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.query=Enormous tidal forces affect Europa, providing heating to the interior and occasionally causing huge plumes of water to erupt from the moon's southern pole. It has long been thought that a probe could fly through one of these plumes, collecting samples of Europa's sub-surface ocean water without the effort of digging through its thick ice crust. {targetHabName} now provides a staging ground from which a probe can easily be launched.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option0=We already have quite enough alien life to worry about.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.optionDetail0=Research efforts are refocused elsewhere.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome0.Detail=Unfortunately, the probe discovered nothing of interest in the sampled water. While this is disappointing, it may simply be that the ejected water is only from liquid trapped in the icy crust rather than from the sub-surface ocean.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome1=Traces of life found.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} has discovered traces of life within the Europan plume water.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome1.Detail=The probe has returned with water containing traces of alien bacteria! Although dead and damaged by the radiation from Jupiter, it is clear proof that there is at least simple life in the waters of Europa. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome2=Multiple life samples discovered!
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome2.Summary={targetFactionName} has discovered multiple lifeforms within the Europan plume water.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaPlumes.option1.outcome2.Detail=The plume was an especially large one, reaching over 200km in height, which enabled our probe to fill all of its sample-reservoirs. The results are beyond our most optimistic estimations as several types of what are now being called Europan bacteria have been found within. Although dead and damaged by the radiation from Jupiter, it is ample proof that there is at least simple life in the waters of Europa. 

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_EuropaBase_PlumeLife=Europa: Ice Piercer 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_EuropaBase_PlumeLife.summary=After the discovery of life in the plume water, scientists have been clamoring to send a probe into the sub-surface ocean.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_PolarVortexNorth.summary=Temperatures plummet as Polar vortex expands over {targetRegionName}. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_PolarVortexNorth.query=The polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles. It always exists near the poles, and for the most part is held in place by air currents, or jet streams, in the atmosphere. However, these jet steams will at times weaken and shift which allows the area of cold polar air to spread towards the equator, causing a rapid and sharp temperature drop in the areas it expands over. Regions affected may suffer extreme snow or hail showers, and the unusual cold can cause mass frostbite, failing infrastructure, and the closing of schools and workplaces.<br/><br/>As climate change destabilizes the jet streams which keep the polar vortexes in check, expansion towards the equator will likely become ever more common.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_2.option1.outcome0.Detail=After reviewing security camera footage, it became obvious that Helen Clark was our leak. Helen was seen visiting several secure mainframes in order to carry out what she claimed was "routine maintenance", but actually planted packet sniffing devices which siphoned key data into a dummy maintenance log which was sent to an "offsite backup". Close examination revealed that Helen was also the source of the falsified work orders used to justify her access.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_2.option1.outcome1=False positive
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_2.option1.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} failed to catch their leak. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_2.option1.outcome1.Detail=Cade Weiss seemed to be our leak, having been seen accessing several secure rooms that she had no legitimate business in, inspecting server cabling, and investigating the ventilation system. However, as she explained and we were able to verify, she had only been searching for her escaped pet rat, "Mr Squeaks", and checking for gnawed cables in an attempt to trace his movements. Ms Weiss has received a warning, but Mr Squeaks has been safely recovered.<br/><br/>The search for our leak continues.
	
TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Ops_3=Infiltrated: The Final Suspects
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.summary=With only a few possible suspects remaining, the end of our search draws near.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.query=The majority of the people who could have accessed the leaked information have now been thoroughly vetted, leaving only a few possibilities. These few will have their former lives checked in great detail to ascertain that their identities are genuine and they have no dark secrets in their past. However, it is now known we are closing the noose and this is likely to be our last chance. Either we find the leak now or they will surely flee.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0=Make certain of everything, this is our last chance!
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.optionDetail0=<skip/>
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0.outcome0=Leak found!
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0.outcome0.Summary={targetFactionName} caught their leak. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0.outcome0.Detail=The leak was Marvin Nelson, a man with a carefully hidden hobby. Concealed within Marvin's basement we found a series of metal cages, stained with blood and filth, and an elaborate torture chamber filled with ill-used instruments. Buried in the garden we have uncovered dozens of mutilated bodies so far, and there may be hundreds in total. The sheer numbers make us suspect that Marvin did not find his own victims, but was rather supplied by another person or organization whom he repaid by supplying them with our secrets. Unfortunately we will not be able to question Marvin as he was found garroted in his kitchen. It seems his suppliers wished to tie up loose ends before we could catch him.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0.outcome1=Leak flees!
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} failed to catch their leak, who has now escaped.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Ops_3.option0.outcome1.Detail=We identified the leak as "Keelan Sosa", or rather the woman who had assumed her identity, as trace DNA recovered from her workstation does not match the DNA from the real Keelan's annual medical checkup. What happened to Keelan and how the false Keelan was able to replace her is currently unknown, as the impostor has escaped after disabling all six security agents sent to bring her in for questioning.<br/><br/>Additional security measures, including random blood tests, have been implemented to avoid this method succeeding again in the future.<br/><br/>Although we are left with more questions than answers, it seems that our leak problem has been solved. For now.
	
TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Money_1=Infiltrated: Rewards for Information
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.summary=We've made it clear that any information which helps us catch the leak will be handsomely rewarded.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.query=It's a rare traitor who can keep their plotting entirely compartmentalized. They may make subtle hints that they are unhappy with their employer, frequently complain, or outright boast that they'll soon have their revenge. Often they think they can trust those they confide in, but in the face of a huge financial reward it takes a firm friendship indeed to stay silent. By offering a large reward for information leading to the discovery of the identity of the leak, it is hoped that anyone with knowledge or suspicions will come forward. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.option0=Money talks.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.option0.outcome0.Summary={targetFactionName} caught their leak. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.option0.outcome0.Detail=For someone who caused us such damage, Talia Rice turned out to have remarkably poor self control. Unable to help herself, Rice has recently been boasting about her big break and early retirement to anyone who would listen. This resulted in multiple people filing reports of her suspicious behavior. During her arrest she frequently threatened our security agents with reprisals from 'her new friends.' Rice freely admitted to selling our secrets when questioned, but she seems to know very little about who these new friends of hers actually are.   
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.option0.outcome1=False report.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.option0.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} followed a false lead, failing to discover their leak. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_1.option0.outcome1.Detail=Many reports pointed our investigators towards Mia Rogers, who has recently been frequently heard to say that vengeance would soon be hers, people would pay for wronging her, and other words to similar effect. However, questioning soon revealed that she was only awaiting the results of a meal filled with laxatives which was meant to deter thieves. Rogers had been upset by her co-workers in the accounting department eating her lunches from the shared department fridge and hatched a plan to teach them a lesson. Warnings have been handed out to all involved.<br/><br/>The search for our leak continues.
	
TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Money_2=Infiltrated: Greater Rewards
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_2.summary=Initial results have been poor, so the promised rewards have been increased.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_2.query=So far we have not received any useful information about the leak, but our investigators remain sure that someone must have some. Accordingly, greater rewards have been offered in the hopes that they will come forward.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_2.option0.outcome0.Detail=The leak, Benedict Miles, has been found. He was turned in by Larissa Hart, a co-worker he was having an affair with. Ms. Hart became suspicious recently when Miles was able to buy her increasingly lavish gifts and luxurious romantic getaways even though she knew he had not been promoted within {targetFactionName}. Miles has been taken into custody and will be questioned.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_2.option0.outcome1=False report.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_2.option0.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} followed a false lead, failing to discover their leak.  
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_2.option0.outcome1.Detail=Lincoln Berger was accused of being the leak, but was soon revealed to be innocent. The accusations stemmed from Lincoln's generally abrasive manner and tendency to be unwilling to accept when he is proven wrong, causing him to be quite unpopular with his co-workers.<br/><br/>The search for our leak continues. 

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Money_3=Infiltrated: Big Money, Big Prizes!
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_3.summary=We have increased the reward to such a degree that it has become irresistible. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_3.query=After further increasing the reward offered and including a promise of amnesty for any lesser crimes, we finally gained a solid lead. The leak, Bella Morgan, was turned in by her lover and unwilling accomplice, Hannah Yang. Yang confessed that she used her position in information security to erase system logs and security camera footage to cover for Morgan.<br/><br/>"At first Bella told me she was just making a little extra money selling used computer parts instead of disposing of them," said Yang, "but once I had covered for that she had more and more demands, and when I balked she told me I was already just as guilty as her. That we'd both go to jail if I didn't keep covering her tracks."<br/><br/>Morgan has been captured and will face interrogation. Yang was given her reward and the promised amnesty, but will no longer work for {targetFactionName}.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Money_3.option0=Our approach paid off.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Influence_1=Infiltrated: Reaching Out
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.summary=With a traitor in our ranks we must seek outside help.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.query=We have at least one traitor in our organization, so no one can be trusted. Instead we will use our influence, control, or outstanding favors owed to request help from the global intelligence agencies. Each will be given part of the data we have, so that no one agency learns too much about our operations, and their reports will be independently amalgamated by several isolated teams here before their combined reports are cross-referenced. The points where these reports agree will hopefully lead us to our leak.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.option0=Check the reports.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.optionDetail0=<skip/>
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.option0.outcome0=Leak revealed.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.option0.outcome0.Detail=One man's name instantly stood out in the unified reports. Sydney Pierce was somehow able to pass our security clearances, but is apparently well-known to the various intelligence agencies we were able to consult with. While Pierce's leaking days are at an end, this does have the disturbing implication that our security screening process is deeply compromised and will need to be completely overhauled.  
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.option0.outcome1=Meaningless coincidences.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.option0.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} discovered no useful date about their leak.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_1.option0.outcome1.Detail=So far no useful connections have been made, although some interesting patterns are evident in the integrated data. For example, members of {targetFactionName} are slightly more likely than average to watch anime, pay their taxes on time, and react to new situation with violence.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Influence_2=Infiltrated: Cooperation 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_2.summary=The second batch of reports from our allies have arrived.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_2.query=After the disappointing first batch of reports we have brought several more agencies onboard to provide additional analysis. It is hoped that with even more eyes on the problem more data points will be discovered when the reports are cross-referenced.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_2.option0.outcome0.Detail=Dafydd Kerr has been revealed as our leak and apprehended for interrogation after a nearly undetectable transmission device was found implanted under his skin. While Kerr has never been charged or even seriously investigated for espionage, which is why he was able to pass our security checks, he was noted as a person of interest in a staggeringly high number of cases worldwide when our combined reports were studied. In every case irrefutable evidence implicating another was found before anyone looked too closely at Kerr, and yet the sheer unlikeliness of his constant appearances was enough to warrant a surprize raid on his home. Not being beholden to due process has certain advantages. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_2.option0.outcome1=Meaningless coincidences.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_2.option0.outcome1.Summary={targetFactionName} discovered no useful date about their leak.
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_2.option0.outcome1.Detail=No useful data has been found yet, although a number of new patterns have been observed. Members of {targetFactionName} tend to have above average levels of martial arts training, even for non-combat positions, are more likely to be left-handed than the global norm, and have a statistically unlikely but entirely understandable love for large dogs. 

TINarrativeEventTemplate.displayName.event_infiltrated_Influence_3=Infiltrated: With A Little Help From Our Friends
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_3.summary=We have rallied the resources of every major intelligence agency, and not a few minor ones. 
TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_infiltrated_Influence_3.query=Not only have we brought almost every global intelligence agency into our search via control, influence, or favors, we initiated a never before seen level of cooperation between them in an effort to cross-pollinate in the hopes of a breakthrough. It worked. Our leak was Jermaine Frost, or at least that's the identity that he was using. His cover was perfectly crafted, it was only due to an unprecedented level of asset sharing and cross-referencing that an anomaly was found: Frost's records in several totally unrelated agencies contained certain subtle word choices and patterns which suggested they had all been written by the same person, something only our grand search could have uncovered.<br/><br/>When surrounded and confronted by our investigation team, Frost was seen to give a wry smile before collapsing, dead instantly. His body began to decompose unnaturally quickly afterwards, which resulted in us being unable to discover much from his autopsy besides an implant containing highly concentrated spider venom.<br/><br/>Many question about Jermaine Frost remain unanswered, but at least he will not be leaking any more of our secrets.

TINarrativeEventTemplate.event_PoliticalDivision.query=A serious scandal coupled with collapsing polling numbers has the opposition fighting among themselves, leaving the ruling party an almost uncontested vote. The government is only likely to be able to advance one policy before the opposition circle the wagons and once more present a united front.<br/><br/>If desired, this moment of advantage could be ignored to strengthen the nation's democratic institutions and promote future cooperation.
