UI.Nation.ArmiesTooltip=Armies are powerful and expensive assets that belong to nations. Each army represents multiple divisions of troops, air support, and a logistics train sufficient for the unit to take and hold territory outside their home nation's borders.<br/><br/>Naval armies, marked with an {0}, are supported by a combat and transport fleet, and are able to cross oceans if the nation's naval score exceeds that of its enemies.<br/><br/>Armies are bound to a particular control point in a nation; the owner of that control point commands the army's actions. Use of armies on foreign soil are subject the nation's relations; they may be stationed in allied nations and only enter the territory of hostile nations during war.<br/><br/>Each nation may have one army per region it controls; if a region joins another nation, any armies based in that region will belong to the new nation.
UI.Nation.PrioritiesTooltip=The settings in the Priorities tab control the distribution of Investment Points, which represent surplus economic capital generated by the nation.<br/><br/>The owner of each control point may direct a share of Investment Points into any number of priorities, either by selecting a preset in the dropdown menu or setting them directly by clicking a spot in the grid.<br/><br/>Investments are distributed by setting weights (0, 1, 2 or 3) for each priority, and the amount of investment going to a particular priority depends on the total number of weights set for a particular control point.<br/><br/>Investment Points gradually fill buckets for each priority; once filled, the nation receives the effects of that priority, and in most cases it may be filled again.
UI.Nation.RegionsTooltip=Regions are the geographic areas that make up a nation.

UI.Nation.EconomyPriorityTip=The Economy priority represents investments in industry and growth. Investing in this priority increases the per capita GDP of the nation by ${0}, inequality by {1}, and increases the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by a small amount {2}. The number of core economic and resource regions in the nation impacts these values. Higher levels of democracy and education, and middle values of cohesion, lead to more innovation and higher increases in income.
UI.Nation.WelfarePriorityTip=The Welfare priority represents redistribution of wealth and repairing harm done to the environment. Completing the Welfare priority decreases inequality by {0} and mitigates global environmental hazards by reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere toward safer levels {1}. <br/><br/>This priority has a warning symbol when inequality is increasing in a nation.
UI.Nation.KnowledgePriorityTip=The Knowledge priority covers investments in education and the free flow of information. Completing the Knowledge priority increases education by {0}, government by {1}, and pulls cohesion toward the middle value of 5 by {2}.
UI.Nation.UnityPriorityTip=The Unity priority represents a national effort to unify the people against a common foe, at the cost of some civil protections for dissenters. Investing in the Unity priority will increase cohesion by {0} and decrease the Government score by {1}. It also will shift public opinion toward factions with control points in this nation. This priority is less effective in nations with higher education levels.
UI.Nation.MilitaryPriorityTip=The Military priority represents investments in internal security and military technology. It will lower unrest by {0} and increase miltech by {1}. The impact on unrest is higher in nations with low democracy. Miltech will go up faster in nations with no unrest. <br/><br/>A warning symbol will accompany the priority if unrest is increasing in the nation or it is in a civil war.
UI.Nation.SpoilsPriorityTip=Spoils represents the direct extraction of wealth from an economy, accomplished by avoiding the true costs of obtaining it. This covers such behaviors as crime and corruption, regulatory capture and tax avoidance, economic rents, unmitigated pollution and exploitation of labor. Completing the Spoils priority grants {0} directly to the owner of each control point (except those suffering from a crackdown effect), increases inequality by {1}, decreases democracy by {2} and significantly increases global greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. {3}{3}<br/><br/>If this priority has a warning symbol, the nation's elites are receiving insufficient spoils to fulfill their desires; elites in this nation require at least {4} of Investment Points directed to them, a value that will decrease with investments in education and democracy, or very high national cohesion. When the elites are dissatisfied, coup d'etats are more likely to occur.
UI.Nation.SpaceDevelopmentPriorityTip=The Funding priority directs national resources into legitimate government and private efforts to support space programs and other goals for the owners of its control points. While not as profitable as the Spoils priority, it does no harm to the nation. Completing this priority permanently increases the nation's annual funding by {0}, which becomes income for owners of control points in this nation.
UI.Nation.SpaceflightProgramPriorityTip=This one-time priority, for nations that do not have a domestic spaceflight program at the campaign's start, will unlock the Boost and Mission Control priorities once completed.
UI.Nation.MissionControlPriorityTip=Completing the Mission Control priority grants one Mission Control to the nation. New facilities will tend to go in regions that already have Mission Control facilities. A region's Mission Control maximum capacity is a function of the region's GDP and education.
UI.Nation.LaunchFacilitiesPriorityTip=The Boost priority covers the construction of launch facilities for rockets and other surface-to-orbit craft, increasing the nation's total boost. The amount of boost created increases with proximity to the equator, and new facilities will tend to go in regions that are closer to the equator or already have launch facilities.
UI.Nation.BuildArmyPriorityTip=The Build Army priority will create a new Army in the nation. Each army reduces the number of Investment Points available to the nation, with the cost being higher if the army is deployed away from its home region. New Armies will be assigned to higher-numbered Control Points before lower-numbered ones. Nations may build one Army per non-colony region, and a nation may only build an army if it has at least {0} million in population, and additional armies may be formed for every {1} million population.
UI.Nation.UpgradeArmyPriorityTip=The Build Navy priority will add a Navy to an Army, allowing it to cross oceans. Like armies, each navy reduces the number of Investment Points available to the nation. New Navies will be assigned to Armies at higher-numbered Control Points first. Nations with {0} or more control points may build Navies. Wealthy nations with {1} control points may build one navy if its per-capita GDP exceeds ${2}.
UI.Nation.InitiateNuclearProgramPriorityTip=This priority will add one nuclear barrage to the nation's stockpile. Nations without nuclear weapons require more investment to make their first one.
UI.Nation.BuildNuclearWeaponsPriorityTip=This priority will add one nuclear barrage to the nation's stockpile.
UI.Nation.BuildSpaceDefensesPriorityTip=The Space Defenses priority constructs a surface-to-orbit weapons array in one region in the nation. More valuable and populous regions will be protected first. Space Defenses prevent alien landings and nuclear strikes on the region it is located in, and fire back at fleets conducting orbital bombardment against targets in the region.

UI.Nation.DiversityBonus=Directing any Investment Points to the {0} priority confers a {1} bonus to all investments for a particular control point, as long as at least one other priority is also receiving any Investment Points from the control point.
UI.Nation.DiversityBonus2=Our current priorities are receiving a {0} diversity bonus for this control point from our investments in the {1} priorities.

UI.Nation.EconomyPriorityGeneric=The Economy priority represents investments in industry and growth. Investing in this priority increases the per capita GDP of the nation while also increasing inequality and the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by small amounts. The number of core economic and resource regions in the nation impacts these values. Higher levels of democracy and education, and middle values of cohesion, lead to more innovation and higher increases in income.<br/><br/>Investments in this priority grant a bonus to all investments for the target control point, as long as at least one other priority is receiving Investment Points.
UI.Nation.WelfarePriorityGeneric=The Welfare priority represents redistribution of wealth and repairing harm done to the environment. Completing the Welfare priority decreases inequality and mitigates global environmental hazards by reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere toward safer levels.<br/><br/>Investments in this priority grant a bonus to all investments for the target control point, as long as at least one other priority is receiving Investment Points.
UI.Nation.KnowledgePriorityGeneric=The Knowledge priority covers investments in education and the free flow of information. Completing the Knowledge priority increases education, Government (democracy), and pulls cohesion toward the middle value of 5.<br/><br/>Investments in this priority grant a bonus to all investments for the target control point, as long as at least one other priority is receiving Investment Points.
UI.Nation.UnityPriorityGeneric=The Unity priority represents a national effort to unify the people against a common foe, at the cost of some civil protections for dissenters. Investing in the Unity priority will increase cohesion and decrease the Government score slightly. It also will shift public opinion toward factions with control points in this nation. This priority is less effective in nations with higher education levels.<br/><br/>Investments in this priority grant a bonus to all investments for the target control point, as long as at least one other priority is receiving Investment Points.
UI.Nation.MilitaryPriorityGeneric=The Military priority represents investments in internal security and military technology. It will increase miltech and lower unrest. The impact on unrest is higher in nations with low democracy. Miltech will go up faster in nations with no unrest.<br/><br/>Investments in this priority grant a bonus to all investments for the target control point, as long as at least one other priority is receiving Investment Points.
UI.Nation.SpoilsPriorityGeneric=Spoils represents the direct extraction of wealth from an economy, accomplished by avoiding the true costs of obtaining it. This covers such behaviors as crime and corruption, regulatory capture and tax avoidance, economic rents, unmitigated pollution, and exploitation of labor. Completing the Spoils priority grants money directly to the owner of each control point (except those suffering from a crackdown effect), increases inequality, decreases democracy, and significantly increases global greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Elites in a nation demand a certain amount of Investment Points be devoted to this priority, a value that will decrease with investments in education and democracy, or very high national cohesion. When the elites are dissatisfied, coup d'etats are more likely to occur.
UI.Nation.SpaceDevelopmentPriorityGeneric=The Funding priority directs national resources into legitimate government and private efforts to support space programs and other goals for the owners of its control points. While not as profitable as the Spoils priority, it does no harm to the nation. Completing this priority permanently increases the nation's annual funding value, which becomes income for owners of control points in this nation.

UI.Nation.CohesionHelp1Short=A nation's Cohesion represents the level of unity or conflict among the people of the nation. High values reduce unrest and improve the nation's ability to resist occupation. Middle values improve research. Inequality, nation size and population, anocracy, divergent ideologies between elites and the public, and losing armies in wars decrease it. Autocratic governments, wars and near-peer rivalries where at least one nation isn't a democracy, and the Unity priority increase it. Democracy and the Knowledge priority pull it toward the middle value of 5.
UI.Nation.CohesionHelp1=A nation's Cohesion represents the level of unity or conflict among the people of the nation. This includes cultural, ideological, ethnic and religious similarities and differences. High values describe a unified society that brooks little deviation or dissent. Middle values represent a diverse society that has both internal conflict and a healthy, creative counterculture. Middle-low values represent a high degree of political polarization, and the lowest values mean the nation's people are fragmented or even tribal. High values keep unrest in check and increase the nation's ability to resist occupation, while middle values provide a bonus to national research production, representing a robust (if messy) marketplace of ideas, low values will rapidly increase unrest. Cohesion is lowered by high inequality, anocracy, having lots of regions or a large population, destruction of armies, and a large difference between public opinion and the ideology of control point owners. Cohesion is increased by autocracy and the Unity priority, and by rivalries and wars when at least one nation involved is not a democracy. Having a high Democracy score pulls cohesion toward a middle value.
UI.Nation.CohesionHelp2=Cohesion increases by {0} per {1} in the Unity priority. It changes by {2} toward the value of 5 per {3} in the Knowledge priority. It will drop rapidly if inequality in a nation is severe. Any effect that would drop cohesion below 0 will apply any difference to lowering democracy to a value of 5, and then to increasing unrest.

UI.Nation.Cohesion10=Monolithic
UI.Nation.InequalityHelp1=A nation's Inequality score is a measure of how wealth and income is distributed in the nation. High values mean the nation doesn't have much of a middle class. Inequality grows by a little as a product of normal economic activity (the Economy Priority) or by a lot because of corruption (the Spoils Priority). Resource regions in a nation can contribute to inequality. High inequality reduces Cohesion as the nation divides into haves and have-nots. It is countered by use of the Welfare priority.
UI.Nation.InequalityHelp2=Inequality changes by {0} per {1} in the Welfare Priority. Any effect that would increase inequality above 9 applies the difference to lowering cohesion and increasing unrest.

UI.Nation.Inequality5=High
UI.Nation.Inequality6=Very High

UI.Nation.UnrestHelp1=The Unrest score represents violent resistance to the political, economic or cultural status quo in this nation. High unrest hampers the economy and may result in a coup or revolution, which will transfer or clear many or all of the nation's Control Points at once. Unrest is fed by low Cohesion and low quality of life (per-capita GDP). Military spending and armies can reduce it, especially in non-democracies.
UI.Nation.UnrestHelp2=Unrest changes by {0} per {1} in the Military Priority.

UI.Nation.EducationHelp1=A nation's Education value is scored based on the average years of schooling a citizen in this nation receives as well as the quality of education there. Nations with higher education scores produce more research and are more resistant to extreme propaganda but gain less cohesion from the Unity priority.

UI.Nation.GDPHelp1=A nation's GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of its annual economic output in U.S. dollars adjusted by purchasing power parity. The nation's GDP determines how many Control Points a nation has, how many Investment Points it produces, and how difficult certain missions there are.
UI.Nation.PerCapitaGDPHelp1=A nation's per-capita GDP is its <h>Gross Domestic Product</h> divided by its population. It represents the economic conditions for the average citizen of this nation. Nations with low per-capita GDP will face higher unrest while the people's needs are not being met.<br/><br/>Putting investment points into the Economy priority can increase GDP. Conflict, population loss, and climate change are among the things that can cause it to decrease.
UI.Nation.PerCapitaGDPHelp2=Per Capita GDP increases by ${0} per {1} in the Economy priority.
UI.Nation.DemocracyHelp1=A nation's Government score measures the amount of democracy in a country, which represents things like civil liberties, popular selection of leaders, press freedoms, and rule of law via an independent judiciary. This impacts many things, including national stability and cohesion, research production, corruption, economic growth and the effectiveness of the military in controlling unrest. 
UI.Nation.DemocracyHelp2=Government increases by {0} per {1} in the Knowledge priority. It changes by {2} per {3} in the Unity priority.

UI.Nation.ControlPointDescription=Control points represent key nodes of political and economic power in a nation. The number of control points is set by the size of the nation's economy. The faction that owns a control point has loyal followers in positions of authority. Control points grant their faction a portion of the nation's critical resources, control over the nation's armies, and the ability to direct the nation's economic priorities.
UI.Nation.ControlPointCost=Once a faction has accumulated a sufficient amount of control in multiple nations, additional control points cost influence per month to maintain, and Crackdown and Purge missions against the faction's control points will receive a bonus. The cost increases with the more control points a faction owns, and the size of the economy of each nation the faction owns control points in. Control Points that have sustained a Crackdown do not cost any influence to maintain.
UI.Nation.NextControlPointCost_m=Taking this control point will incur a monthly cost of {0} influence.
