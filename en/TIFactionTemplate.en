TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.ResistCouncil=My name is {1}. I'm speaking for the global resistance against the alien invasion. We have captured an alien infiltrator and learned their true purpose is to enslave us all to use as foot soldiers in their wars against other species. They are operating out of a base located beyond Neptune. They are using a piece of technology called a wormhole to transport themselves from another star system. We have the means to close that wormhole permanently. Our forces will launch for their base to deliver this weapon. Do not interfere; we will defend ourselves against any attempt to stop us.
TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.DestroyCouncil=I am {0} {1}, leader of {2}. I speak to the alien known as {3}, and its minions in our Solar System. We are coming for you. We will burn your armies, your fleets, and your bases. We will find your home and destroy it, root and branch.<br/><br/>We are coming for you!
TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.ExploitCouncil=Fellow citizens of Earth, I am {0} {1}. My organization has been quietly working to address the alien threat to us all. Our initiative has achieved great things, and we now have an opportunity to strike a blow for all of humanity. We are preparing a fleet of warships to send to the alien headquarters and force their surrender, and usher in a new age of prosperity for all of mankind. Do not impede us. Our victory is at hand.
TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.SubmitCouncil=People of Earth, I am {1}, {0} of {2}! I am here as an envoy of our benevolent saviors. Today we proclaim our joyous destiny: one united world under their guidance. We call upon all nations to cease their futile and violent resistance, and to open negotiations to join our global family. Only then may we know peace and serenity.
TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.EscapeCouncil=I have the honor of being the {0} of {2}. As many of you have no doubt heard, our organization has set out to bridge the gap between the stars, much as the alien interlopers have. Today, we are announcing we have overcome every technological hurdle and are ready to build our first ark to colonize a habitable world around another sun. While we have already selected our crew and many colonists, we will be auctioning 100 seats, and holding a lottery for another 100 qualifying individuals. We will be making details available shortly.<br/><br/>We hope you can join us as fellow pioneers in humanity's greatest achievement!
TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.AppeaseCouncil=I am {1}, {0} of the organization known as {2}. My friends, today we are announcing that during secret negotiations, we have reached an accord with the alien invaders that will spare humanity from the violence they are capable of inflicting upon us. They have agreed to allow us to govern ourselves, under their distant but watchful eye, as long as humanity remains on Earth. They have asked the Protectorate to ensure that humanity abides by this pledge. To that end, we will be constructing a series of peacekeeping battlestations in Low Earth Orbit to prevent anyone from breaking the agreement and bringing the aliens' fury down upon all of us. I call on Earth's nations to support our efforts and not interfere; doing so puts us all at risk of an unspeakable fate.
TIFactionTemplate.VictoryNotification.CooperateCouncil=I am here to address all of humanity. We have suffered through uncertain times since the alien arrival, fighting against a seemingly implacable foe. But we, {2}, have studied these aliens. They are the product of a tragic history, and they see war and subterfuge as the only means to preserve their species. They do have a dangerous evolutionary adaptation that makes humans servile to their wishes, but we have discovered the means to resist that. We are preparing to send members of our diplomatic corps to the alien base to negotiate a stable, lasting peace. We are not going in defenseless, and we expect them to oppose us on the way, but we are resolved to see this through. Please carry our envoys in your thoughts; they go to save us all.
